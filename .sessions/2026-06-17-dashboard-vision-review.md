# Session — review the dashboard vision plan + control-panel session close

> **Status:** `complete`

## Origin

Owner's final task: *"sync to main and review the new plan, what do you think, can we improve it? …
start the end of session sequence and include a review of the plan in your last PR."* The new plan is
**`docs/planning/dashboard-vision-finalized-state.md`** (#1002) — a north-star vision synthesizing an
external deep-research report + Codex PR #998.

## Arc of this session (the control panel, end to end)

This session shipped **and activated** SuperBot's live, multi-user control panel:

- **#992** docs reconciliation (caught the #988 near-duplicate via the Q-0126 scan).
- **#993** control-API **mutation endpoints** over the audited seams (settings · help · routing).
- **#996** dashboard **Discord OAuth login + editors** (stdlib HMAC-signed session — no
  `itsdangerous`/`multipart`, so the app stays verifiable with no PyPI installs needed).
- **#1001** health server **IPv6 dual-stack bind** (`HEALTH_HOST=::`) — the prerequisite that made the
  dashboard→bot private-network call work.
- **Railway activation:** set `CONTROL_API_TOKEN` (both services) + `DASHBOARD_SESSION_SECRET` +
  `DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`_REDIRECT_URI`/`CONTROL_API_URL` via the Railway API; owner added the
  client secret. **Confirmed LIVE** — owner logged in + saw their admin guilds; bot logs show
  `control_api: enabled` + `Health server listening on :::8080`.

## The plan review (this PR's deliverable)

Added a dated **§ Reviewer note & post-activation status** to the vision doc + a pointer in its status
block. Verdict: **strong, correctly-structured north-star — adopt it** (it resolves the "three competing
plans" drift by sitting *above* the two execution plans; the four-zone IA, 3-ring authority, freshness
contract, and manifest spine are all sound). Material correction + 4 refinements:

1. **Status is already stale** — the write side went live *today*; Phases C (OAuth+workspace) + F (live
   writes) are shipped/active, and the build **skipped Phase E** (current-value reads).
2. **Elevate Phase E** (control-API read endpoints) to the now-priority — the live editors write **blind**.
3. **Sharpen the manifest gate** — it gates commands/panels, *not* the settings/help/routing editors
   (those shipped on already-typed seams).
4. **Live hardening gap** — the public panel has no rate-limiting + only `SameSite=Lax` (no CSRF token yet).
5. **Add the Railway-IPv6 fact** to the security section (cost the #1001 fix).

Folded #995/#996/#1001/#1002 into the living ledger and marked the panel 🟢 LIVE.

## 💡 Session idea (Q-0089)

**A control-panel link self-check.** Now that the dashboard↔bot link is live, a tiny authenticated probe
— the dashboard calling `/control/ping` (+ `/control/authority` for itself) on a `/admin` health strip or
a startup check — would surface "control API: reachable / unreachable" *before* an admin hits a cryptic
edit failure. Born from this session spending real effort diagnosing reachability (the IPv6 bind, the
token, the deploy state); it turns a silent failure mode into a visible status. Small, read-only, additive.

## ⟲ Previous-session review (Q-0102) — #1002 (the vision plan author)

**Did well:** exactly the right move — folded an external research report + a parallel Codex PR into a
*single* north-star instead of letting a third competing plan drift, and kept the genuinely-additive ideas
(manifest spine, trust matrix). **Missed:** it stamped a "Status today" snapshot that was stale within
hours because it didn't verify against the write side going live in parallel — the same drift class this
session hit with the #988 handoff. **System improvement:** a plan/status doc should, before stamping
status cells, run the cheap check "what merged / activated since I started?" — the in-doc-cell sibling of
the handoff-freshness guard idea (this session's earlier Q-0089). Status cells in living plans need the
same freshness discipline as the ledger.

## 📋 Documentation audit (Q-0104)

`check_docs --strict` green; the session's write-side PRs (#993/#996/#1001) + #995/#1002 are folded into
the living ledger with the LIVE marker; the plan review lives in the vision doc; active-work claims
reconciled. The broader 8-PR ledger drift (non-dashboard lanes) stays for the auto-firing recon routine
(Q-0124). Nothing from this session lives only in chat.
