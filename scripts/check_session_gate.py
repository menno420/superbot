"""Session merge-gate — hold a PR red until its session card says it's done.

The merge race this closes (owner directive Q-0133, 2026-06-14)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Native auto-merge (Q-0123) merges a `claude/*` PR the instant the required
`Code Quality` check goes green. A session that pushes its code first and its
session-close docs (the ledger entry, the `.sessions/` log) second can therefore
merge **before** those docs are pushed — the #843 case: the PR merged without its
ledger entry, leaving a stranded follow-up.

The fix is the owner's: every session declares itself up-front in a single
per-session file that is *both* the start-declaration ("what is about to happen",
visible to parallel/next sessions on the open PR) **and** the end-record ("what
has happened"). That file is the existing `.sessions/<date>-<slug>.md` log, and
its `> **Status:**` badge gates the merge:

* Created in the **first** commit with a HOLD status (`in-progress`) → the PR is
  **born red**, so auto-merge arms but cannot fire (no race window — the gate is
  red from commit 1, not added later).
* Flipped to a READY status (`complete`) as the deliberate **final** step →
  `Code Quality` goes green → auto-merge fires.

Engage-when-present (the safe default Q-0133 chose over airtight): the gate fails
**only** when the PR *adds* a session card whose status is a hold/unknown token. A
PR that adds **no** new session card behaves exactly as before (merges on green),
so workflow-authored PRs (btd6-data-refresh) and any routine that hasn't created a
card are never deadlocked. Creating the card is mandatory **by CLAUDE.md rule** +
the Stop-hook / `/session-close` reminder, not by hard CI enforcement.

Only **newly-added** cards (`git diff --diff-filter=A`) are inspected — a
reconciliation PR that re-badges an *old* log to `historical` is never held.

Pure stdlib (runs in CI's `code-quality` job before any setup) and unit-tested.

Usage:
    python3.10 scripts/check_session_gate.py                 # auto (vs origin/main)
    python3.10 scripts/check_session_gate.py --base SHA --head SHA   # CI
