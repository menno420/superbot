# S1 — Bot product · live state

> **Status:** `living-ledger` — per-sector live snapshot (Q-0195).

> Per-sector snapshot (Q-0195). Hub: [`../current-state.md`](../current-state.md) ·
> Forward queue: [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) § S1 · Folios:

> **Posture — completion-first (Q-0209, 2026-06-27):** the bot is close to production-ready, so S1's
> standing bias is **finish/certify existing features before starting new ones** (a new idea that
> *deepens* an existing game/function counts as deepening, not new). Each game + server function is a
> per-feature unit scored `▢ → ◐ → ✔` in
> [`../planning/feature-completion/`](../planning/feature-completion/README.md); certified only on
> evidence + owner sign-off. Soft default — the owner greenlights brand-new units freely.

**Recently shipped (this sector):**
- **No-dead-end terminal-view arch guard** (#1529, Q-0194 friction→guard) — a warn-tier `no_dead_end`
  rule in `scripts/check_architecture.py` flags any game-view terminal handler (calls `self.stop()`)
  that renders a message without swapping to a nav-carrying view; allowlist for genuine pre-game
  invite decline/timeout. Turns the recurring trapped-view catch (#1521/#1527) from a manual
  per-assessment check into an enforced one. +7 tests; clean on the current fleet.
- **Completion-first PvP dead-end fixes** (#1527, Q-0209) — closed the recurring **trapped-view** bug
  class in both competitive PvP games. **Deathmatch:** PvP `_DuelView`/`_ChallengeView` now swap to
  `_PvpDuelResultView` (Help/Games nav + 🔁 Rematch) on every terminal, and the latent panel-PvP
  `ctx=None` resolve crash was root-fixed (BUG-0028, explicit `guild_id` thread). **RPS:** the PvP
  match result now carries ◀ Back to RPS (`_RpsPvpResultView`) + a rules "Timeouts & forfeits" field.
  Both completion certs advanced toward ✔ (Deathmatch is now a ✔-ready candidate pending owner
  walkthrough). 11 new tests.
- **Reaction-roles arc — Carl-bot-mature** (#1234/#1237/#1242/#1243/#1245/#1246/#1248/#1250):
  multi-emote-per-message, channel/message pickers, role + gradient presets, free temp-roles
  member view, dead-binding self-heal. **PR 6 (PIL banner cards) shipped (#1279);** only the gated web
  builder (Surface A) remains
  ([plan](../planning/reaction-roles-overhaul-plan-2026-06-21.md)).
- **Creature game** — runtime catch/collection (#1208), level-normalized PvP engine + flow
  (#1213/#1230), leaderboard provider (#1244).
- **Mining grid** — seed-deterministic (x,y,z) grid + dig-moves-you (#1281/#1282).
- **Gear loadout presets** (#1499, V-14/Q-0175 Phase-1 unified-loadout) — save your equipped gear as a
  named set (`mining`/`combat`/`fishing`, cap 10) and swap your whole loadout with one click (`💾 Loadouts`
  gear-panel button + `!loadout`). `mining_loadout_presets` (migration 101, direct-lane like
  `mining_equipment`) + `mining_workflow.{save,apply,list,delete}_loadout`; apply equips every still-owned
  item, clears other slots, reports anything no longer owned; reversible + additive.
- **Fishing-specific gear stats** (#1504, V-14/Q-0175 "matching gear → better fishing" half) — makes a
  fishing loadout a **real optimisation**, not just convenience. `EffectiveStats` gained `fishing_power` +
  `bite_luck` (additive, default-0 → existing reads byte-identical), a CHARM-slot **fishing-charm ladder**
  (fishing/anglers/master-angler charm, off the combat SET_SLOTS so duel balance is untouched) in
  `utils/equipment.py` + the gear shop, the pure converter `utils/fishing/gear.py`, and
  `fishing_workflow.begin_cast` now folds them in as the **4th** cast knob (rod × bait × weather ×
  **gear**). Coins-only (no recipe), sim-pinned
  ([numbers](../planning/fishing-gear-numbers-2026-06-27.md)); self-merged on green.
- **Starboard / Hall-of-Fame** — plan #1254 → PR 1 #1259 → PR 2 #1270.
- **Fishing minigame** — cast/reel loop + rod ladder + energy (#1296–#1304, incl. the generous
  sell-value rebalance 1–7 → 1–21 in #1304); **Bait layer** — coin-bought consumable with **both**
  economy knobs: rarity (#1329) + the **bite-speed** half (#1337) on the same
  `CastStart`/cast-view seam, plus speed/combo baits. **Bait crafting** — turn small caught
  fish into bait packs (`fishing_workflow.craft_bait`, the `🪱 Bait` Craft select + `!craftbait`),
  closing `catch → craft → bait → bigger catch` (#1338). **⛵ Boat/deepwater venue** (#1340) — a
  persisted shore↔deepwater toggle (`!sail` + the menu button, migration 094 `fishing_venue`);
  deepwater holds 11 **boat-only species** (uncatchable from shore) and runs a **tougher minigame**
  (6–12 s bites · 22% base escape) so the rod escape-resist knob finally pays off — additive (the
  original 21 shore fish unchanged), the literal §5 shore-cap rebalance left as an owner balance
  call. **Daily weather forecast** (#1341) — a date-seeded global bias
  (`utils/fishing/weather.py`, no DB) compounding onto the cast as a third how-well knob
  (rod × bait × weather): clear/rain/calm/fog/storm, the same for everyone each day; `!forecast` +
  a menu/cast forecast line. **Trophy records per species** (#1351) — each catch now rolls
  an individual weight (`utils/fishing/weight.py`); the catch-log keeps your heaviest of each species
  (migration 095 re-adds `best_weight`), the Fishdex shows the personal-best beside each tally, and a
  fresh record celebrates "🏅 New personal best!" on the catch — a cheap long-tail retention goal.
  **Trophy follow-ups** (#1356, this PR) — the **soft-fail clue** (a *trophy* that slips the hook now
  names itself, `minigame.escape_clue`, so a lost big fish baits the next cast) + the **heaviest-catch
  leaderboard** `!trophies` (`bigfish`/`fishtrophy`, `db.top_trophies` off the `best_weight` record) —
  a "Biggest Catches" hall of fame where trophies compete server-wide.
- **Casino — multiplayer poker** (PR #1333) — a new Games-hub child for **group** card games with
  **per-player auto-updating ephemeral** hands; v1 = Texas Hold'em (play-chips). Pure `utils/cards/`
  + `utils/poker/` (eval + engine w/ side pots, fully tested) + the `views/casino/` ephemeral
  broadcast table. [design](../planning/casino-poker-design-2026-06-22.md).

**▶ Next startable (one of):**
*(offline-fit tags — `[offline]` self-mergeable now · `[needs-live-bot]` needs a running bot / runtime
creds · `[owner]` needs an owner decision/action; see [`../repo-sector-map.md`](../repo-sector-map.md)
§ "the offline-fit startability tag". A tag reflects the arc's *next actionable* step.)*
- `[offline]` **Feature-completion assessments — IN PROGRESS (7/36 assessed).** The completion-first arc
  (Q-0209). #1519 added Fishing/Counting/Word Chain to the #1513 Blackjack pilot; the
  born-red-gate-fix dispatch run (2026-06-28, PR #1524) added **RPS, Deathmatch, Chicken farm**. **▶ Next
  startable, offline:** (1) **assess more units** — the remaining unassessed games (Mining [big read],
  Casino, Creatures) then server-fns, one cert each under
  [`../planning/feature-completion/units/`](../planning/feature-completion/README.md) from the rubric.
  **✅ (2) DONE 2026-06-28 (#1529):** the **"no-dead-end" arch guard** shipped — a warn-tier
  `no_dead_end` rule in `scripts/check_architecture.py` (config + allowlist in
  `architecture_rules/canonical_helpers.yaml`, +7 tests) flags a game-view terminal handler that
  `self.stop()`s + renders a message without swapping to a nav-carrying view, so the trapped-view bug
  class is caught automatically instead of per-assessment ([idea](../ideas/no-dead-end-terminal-view-guard-2026-06-28.md),
  now `historical`). **✅ DONE
  2026-06-28 (#1527):** the Deathmatch PvP trapped views (+ the panel-PvP `ctx=None` crash, BUG-0028)
  **and** the RPS PvP-result dead-end were both fixed — `_PvpDuelResultView` / `_RpsPvpResultView` with
  standard nav + rematch/back; both certs advanced toward ✔. The next turn-key gap is **Blackjack
  punch-list #1** (split/insurance/surrender — bigger engine work, owner-paced). **▶ Owner decisions
  waiting:** Word Chain re-classify, Counting XP/coin reward, Deathmatch optional coin-staking, plus
  every assessed unit's `◐ → ✔` live-walkthrough sign-off
  (`[needs-live-bot]`/`[owner]`).
- `[offline]` **Fishing-specific gear stats — SHIPPED 2026-06-27 (#1504)** (see Recently shipped above):
  the Q-0175 "matching gear → better fishing" half is done — `fishing_power`/`bite_luck` on
  `EffectiveStats`, a CHARM-slot fishing-charm ladder, and the cast's 4th knob in `begin_cast`.
  **Acquisition depth SHIPPED 2026-06-27 (PR #1508):** the three charms now have a **fish→charm craft
  path** (`!craftcharm`) mirroring the catch→bait loop — consume caught fish (smallest-first) → grant one
  charm into the mining inventory, so a dedicated fisher can earn the whole ladder by fishing; coins stay
  the fast alternative ([craft numbers](../planning/fishing-charm-craft-numbers-2026-06-27.md)). **The
  rod-ladder craft path SHIPPED 2026-06-27 (PR #1515):** `!craftrod` (+ a **🎣 Craft from fish** button in
  the rod shop) crafts the next rod up from caught fish (smallest-first), mirroring the charm/bait loops —
  `rods.ROD_RECIPES` + `fishing_workflow.craft_rod` (inventory-only, one transaction, no coins/audit);
  coins stay the fast alternative via `buy_rod`
  ([rod craft numbers](../planning/fishing-rod-craft-numbers-2026-06-27.md)). **The fish-loot-drop
  successor ALSO SHIPPED 2026-06-27 (PR #1515):** a **🍀 lucky double catch** — `BONUS_CATCH_CHANCE`
  (0.10) that a successful reel lands a *second* copy of the same fish (extra craft fodder straight into
  the bait/charm/rod craft loops), rolled in `commit_catch` via pure `rewards.roll_bonus_catch`,
  byte-identical when it doesn't fire, never a second dex/trophy row
  ([bonus-catch numbers](../planning/fishing-bonus-catch-numbers-2026-06-27.md)). **The fish-loot
  rare-material drop ALSO SHIPPED 2026-06-28 (PR #1518):** the **pearl** 🦪 — a dedicated rare
  crafting material a successful reel can also yield (size-scaled chance: bigger fish → better odds,
  `utils/fishing/rewards.roll_pearl_drop`, byte-identical when it doesn't fire). Its **repeatable**
  sink is a **pearl-only craft path** for the premium **Royal Feast** bait (the one bait left with no
  fish recipe — a pure coin sink today): `!craftpearl` + a bait-shop "Craft from pearls" select spend
  `bait.PEARL_BAIT_RECIPES` pearls via `fishing_workflow.craft_pearl_bait`; coins stay the fast
  alternative. No DB migration (pearls reuse the generic `mining_inventory` store), sim-pinned
  ([pearl numbers](../planning/fishing-pearl-numbers-2026-06-28.md)). ▶ **Next offline successor:**
  a **fish-loot rare *material*-drop variant** (a dedicated craft material that feeds a *new* craft
  target rather than the premium bait — e.g. a "kelp"/"driftwood" that crafts a cosmetic or a
  structure) **or** the **rod-ladder recipe browser** UI. Pure + sim-pinnable, self-mergeable.
- `[needs-live-bot]` **Essential Setup spine — PR 1 COMPLETE + polished, incl. step 0, + CUT OVER as the primary `!setup`
  (owner-directed, 2026-06-24).** A new plain-language, button/dropdown/multi-select-only quick-setup flow
  (**7 steps**: what kind of server is this · greet · moderators · block spam · choose a log channel ·
  reward active members · help desk + summary). Each step applies immediately (direct lane) through an
  audited service; typing is optional everywhere (Q-0205). Shipped #1425/#1427/#1429/#1432/#1434 + polish
  #1435; decisions Q-0202/Q-0203/Q-0204/Q-0205. **Step 0 (server-type starter preset) shipped #1437** —
  `ServerTypeStep`, the new first step; five starter sets applied as pure direct-apply settings bundles
  (`_SERVER_TYPES`, automod/moderation/XP-rate), instant + reversible, no resource creation. **Cutover
  (owner-directed, 2026-06-24):** Essential Setup is now the **primary `!setup` / `/setup`** (was
  `!quicksetup`); the old section-list wizard moved to **`!setupadvanced` / `/setup-advanced`**; Essential
  Setup now opens in a separate **`#superbot-setup`** channel (not the invoking channel) and is what the
  on-join launcher's **Start Setup** opens. **PR 2 (extras menu + "Check my setup") SHIPPED 2026-06-25**
  (dispatch run) — the "All done" summary now offers **More to set up** (a plain menu of the optional
  features the spine skips, each with its setup command) + **Check my setup** (a jargon-free readiness
  health check). **PR 3a (retire dead/legacy sections) SHIPPED 2026-06-25** (dispatch run, PR #1451) — the
  7 dead read-only/metadata/announcement/link-only sections (`purpose`/`identity`/`btd6`/`ai_setup`/
  `readiness`/`diagnostics`/`suggestions`) deleted, `server_scan`'s button unregistered (cache module kept
  for `channels`), `cleanup` demoted advanced-only; the Advanced (`!setupadvanced`) wizard now only shows
  steps that do real config. **▶ Next:** **PR 3b** — rework the Advanced draft→Final-Review editor (Q-E,
  "currently most of it does not do anything") + delete the now-dead service code; **heavier, needs
  live-bot verification.** Tracker:
  [`planning/setup-wizard-restructure-plan-2026-06-24.md`](../planning/setup-wizard-restructure-plan-2026-06-24.md).
- `[needs-live-bot]` **✅ Consolidation / discoverability audit — COMPLETE (owner-directed, 2026-06-23).** All five goals
  shipped and CI-guarded where possible. Staging brief + per-cog rubric:
  [`planning/consolidation-discoverability-audit-brief-2026-06-23.md`](../planning/consolidation-discoverability-audit-brief-2026-06-23.md).
  - **Every command findable + buttonized** — per-command reachability guard (#1370); gap cogs closed
    (`btd6strat` #1372, `temproles` #1377) → **0 gaps**, baseline emptied, CI-enforced.
  - **No loose ends / forgotten panels** — the ultracode fleet cleared the `edit_in_place` backlog and
    **graduated the rule warn→error** (#1375; U1 AI panels #1376, U2 roles #1377, U3 games hub #1378);
    **universal Help + Back-to-hub on every panel** (#1382); **game-result continuation buttons** (#1383).
  - **Settings centralized** — the settings-reachability guard (#1385): 19/19 reachable, 0 gaps, CI-enforced.
  - **AI advisor finalized** — describe → propose → **Accept/Deny/Edit** → confirm → audited apply
    (#1386 + bind re-pick #1390); Q-0048 decided (AI applies only after confirmation) → recorded as

    extra with ✅/➖ using the same `setup_readiness.collect` snapshot `build_check_setup_embed` already

    subsystem, so the extra→subsystem mapping can't be confirmed offline; a bot-access session should
    do it) · the **visual card-engine migration** — engine **H2** *renderer-dedup* half **🟡 partially
    shipped (welcome / UX-lab leaderboard+poster / role-menu rebased onto `CardCanvas`, 2026-06-24
    dispatch run)**; the **leaderboard card now ships as a real feature** (`!leaderboard` attaches a
    rendered top-N image with embed fallback, 2026-06-24 dispatch run) — remaining H2 is only the
    `mining_render` rebase (owner visual decision). **H3 *embed-feature → image-card* is underway:**
    `/myprofile` (H1) and now **`!rank`** both render real image cards (`utils/rank_render.py`, themed
    grid + level progress bar, re-rendered on the stat-toggle, embed fallback — 2026-06-24 dispatch
    run). The **`!xpmenu` hub panel** now renders the rank image card too (its direct surface +
    stat-switch buttons, embed fallback — 2026-06-24 dispatch run, PR #1413). The **help-nav
    attachment seam** then shipped (PR #1430, 2026-06-24 dispatch run) — hubs reached *through Help /
    hub navigation* now carry their image card too (`views.navigation.help_nav_card`, a non-viral
    duck-typed `view.help_nav_card` the central render sites forward; XP hub is the first consumer),
    closing the "card via the command, plain embed via Help" split at the root. Remaining H3 is
    **incremental adoption** (other card-bearing hubs set `help_nav_card` in their hook — profile/rank
    hubs are the next adopters) + other showpiece embeds —

- `[offline]` **Project Moon (Limbus) — runtime PR 1 SHIPPED 2026-06-25** (dispatch run, PR #1453): a standalone
  **Limbus knowledge domain** — committed structural/lore facts (`disbot/data/projmoon/limbus/`: 12
  Sinners · 7 Sins · 3 damage types · 5 E.G.O grades · status keywords, provenance-tagged), a typed
  `services/projmoon_data_service.py` (loader + resolver), `utils/projmoon/keywords.py`
  (`has_limbus_context`), and a browsable `!pm` / `/pm` surface (`views/projmoon/`, its own top-level
  **Project Moon** Help hub like BTD6). Read-only, no DB, **no AI hot-path change**. **Lore-depth

  thin `services/projmoon_context_service.build()` injects provenanced Limbus grounding facts (named
