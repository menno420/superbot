# Context-map tooling — `scripts/context_map.py`

> **Status:** `reference` — how to use the context-map tool. Source wins.

## What it is

`scripts/context_map.py` answers one question fast: **"what is connected to this
file, and what should I read/check before editing it?"** Given a path under
`disbot/`, it prints the file's role and layer, its direct imports (module-level
**and** lazy function-body imports, labelled), what imports it, the transitive
blast radius, ownership/authority, related docs and tests, risk flags, and a
recommended read/verify set.

It exists because **CodeGraph cannot resolve this repo's file/module edges** —
`file_deps`, `module_map`, and `impact_analysis` all return zero here (see
`docs/codegraph-usage.md`). CodeGraph stays the tool for *symbol* lookup
(`where`, `list_functions`, `context`, `complexity`); this tool covers
*file/module* dependency context that CodeGraph misses.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/context_map.py disbot/services/moderation_service.py
python scripts/context_map.py disbot/cogs/moderation_cog.py --max-importers 30
```

## Wired into the agent's reflex

So the tool is *used*, not just available (the 2026-06-07 workflow review found it
good but un-surfaced at edit time):

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (CodeGraph section) names it as the file-level reflex:
  run it before your first edit to a `disbot/*.py` file.
- **`scripts/claude_pre_edit.py`** — a `PreToolUse` (Edit|Write) hook — injects the
  map as `additionalContext` the **first time** a `disbot/*.py` file is edited in a
  session (once per file; never blocks; skips non-`disbot` / new-file writes). Run
  it by hand any time you're *planning* a change rather than mid-edit.

## How it resolves edges (and what to trust)

| Section | Source | Trust |
|---|---|---|
| File role / authority | `architecture_rules/mutation_owners.yaml` + layer from path | Authoritative |
| Direct imports (module-level / lazy) | AST (`check_architecture._ImportVisitor`) | Authoritative for *scope* (module-level vs lazy). Names are at `from`-module granularity, so `from services import x` shows as `services`. |
| Imported by / Blast radius | **Grimp** when installed; **AST scan** otherwise | Grimp reliably maps **import/module edges** (resolves `from services import moderation_service` to the submodule + lazy importers). Caveat: import edges ≠ full runtime impact — EventBus/dispatch/decorator edges aren't imports, so the blast radius is import-only. The AST fallback is a **lower bound** (like CodeGraph) and is clearly labelled in the output. |
| Related docs / Relevant tests / Risk | `docs/context-map-overrides.yml` + `layers.yaml` + path mirror | Curated + heuristic — extend the override file as the repo grows. |

The tool **does not map call edges** (function→function). That stays a
grep + CodeGraph (`fn_impact`, then grep-verify) job — see `docs/codegraph-usage.md`.
Decorator-registered Discord handlers (`@commands.command`, `@bot.event`, …) are
framework dispatch, invisible to any static import/call graph.

## Companion — EventBus wiring map (`scripts/wiring_map.py`)

The one runtime-edge class neither the import graph (above) nor CodeGraph's call
graph can see: **string-keyed EventBus dispatch**. An emitter does
`bus.emit("audit.action_recorded", …)`; a subscriber does
`bus.on("audit.action_recorded", handler)` — they share **no import and no call
edge** (verified: `server_logging` subscribes to `audit.action_recorded` but never
imports its emitter `audit_events`). That is the both-tools-blind gap in
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` ("Some edges are invisible to *both* tools").

`scripts/wiring_map.py` resolves it the way the runtime does — AST-scanning
`bus.emit` / `bus.on`, resolving the event name (an `EVT_*` constant or a string
literal), and **joining emitter↔subscriber by event-name string**:

```bash
python3.10 scripts/wiring_map.py                                    # full map + findings
python3.10 scripts/wiring_map.py disbot/services/server_logging.py  # one file's wiring
python3.10 scripts/wiring_map.py --event audit.action_recorded
python3.10 scripts/wiring_map.py --check                            # exit 1 on catalogue drift
```

Same discipline as the context map: stdlib-only, no new dependency, and a **lower
bound** — a parametrized forwarder (`_emit_governance_event(event_name, …)`) or a
non-`bus` receiver shows as `unresolved`, never a guess. `--check` gates only on
**catalogue drift** (an event absent from `core/events_catalogue.KNOWN_EVENTS`); a
"possible dead subscriber" is an advisory hint (FP-prone via forwarders), never a
gate failure. Pinned by `tests/unit/scripts/test_wiring_map.py`.

## Companion — review scope (`scripts/review_scope.py`)

Operationalizes [`repo-review-map.md`](repo-review-map.md): instead of remembering the
review/refactor partition, ask the tool which **review unit** a file or a change belongs
to. `context_map.py` now also prints the file's unit on its header line.

```bash
python3.10 scripts/review_scope.py disbot/cogs/economy_cog.py   # one file → its unit
python3.10 scripts/review_scope.py --diff                       # change vs origin/main
git diff --name-only | python3.10 scripts/review_scope.py --stdin --files
```

It classifies each path into an Axis-A domain and, inside the bot, an Axis-B
**slice** vs. **platform** unit (logic in `scripts/_review_units.py`), then verdicts a
changeset as **single-slice / multi-slice / platform / non-runtime** with review advice.
Pure path logic (no filesystem), so it also classifies deleted/renamed paths from a diff.
Heuristic — services don't map 1:1 to slices, so it says "confirm in `ownership.md`" rather
than guess. Pinned by `tests/unit/scripts/test_review_units.py`.

## Companion — readiness scoreboard & doc freshness

- `scripts/readiness_scoreboard.py` — tallies the
  [production-readiness maps'](planning/production-readiness/README.md) Done/Partial/Not-Done
  cells into a one-glance per-subsystem table; `--write` injects it into that README between
  markers, `--check` gates on staleness. Pinned by `tests/unit/scripts/test_readiness_scoreboard.py`.
<!-- check_doc_freshness.py was deleted 2026-07-06 (Q-0239 G7 — dormant/unwired, no operational
     caller). Dated-snapshot staleness is caught by check_plan_staleness (for plan docs) and the
     reconciliation pass; there is no standalone doc-freshness checker. -->

## Dependency

The importer/blast-radius engine uses **Grimp** (`requirements-dev.txt`, pinned).
Grimp is a developer/agent dependency — it is **not** a bot-runtime dependency and
is **not** installed in CI. The tool degrades to the AST fallback when Grimp is
absent, so `tests/unit/scripts/test_context_map.py` stays green in CI (the
Grimp-specific test is skipped via `pytest.importorskip`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # installs grimp for the full import-graph path
```

## The override file

`docs/context-map-overrides.yml` is the one curated source for the docs/tests/risk
routing that imports alone cannot infer. It maps a file's directory prefix to its
**area folio** and **contract docs** (longest prefix wins; `layer_docs` is the
fallback). Keep entries thin and *link* to authoritative docs — do not restate
their contents (one fact, one home). Add an entry when a new subsystem lands.

## Roadmap (small, phased)

1. **Now** — single-file context map (`context_map.py`, Grimp + AST fallback) **and the
   EventBus wiring map (`wiring_map.py`, emit↔subscribe join + catalogue-drift `--check`)**,
   override file, tests.
2. `--changed` mode: run over a PR's changed files for a combined context digest.
3. Discord-decorator framework-edge scanner (synthetic "invoked by dispatch" edges) — the
   remaining both-tools-blind class after EventBus wiring; could extend `wiring_map.py`.
4. Cache the Grimp graph under `.build/` for repeated queries.
5. Optional CI warn mode (e.g. "you touched a mutation owner — confirm audit emission").
