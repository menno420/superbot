# Untested-surface testing checklist

> **Status:** `audit` — maintained live-walk checklist for every command/UI
> flow that automated tests **cannot** verify.
>
> **Companion to** [`production-eval-checklist-2026-06-10.md`](production-eval-checklist-2026-06-10.md)
> (the point-in-time eval for PRs #606–#672; this doc is the persistent successor).
>
> **Not duplicated here:** surfaces already verified in the production eval
> checklist or covered sufficiently by CI. See the
> [exclusion index](#what-is-not-here) at the bottom.
>
> **Owner:** update status badges (✅ / `[ ]`) as surfaces get walked; record
> the date and PR context beside each ✅ so drift is visible.

## Status legend

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[ ]` | Needs a live walk — never verified, or verification record lost |
| `[~]` | Partially tested (machine tests exist; UX / visual output unverified) |
| `[✅]` | Live-verified — date + evidence noted |
| `[⏳]` | Deferred / gated — reason noted |
| `[🤖]` | Machine-covered sufficiently; human walk not required |

---

## How to use this checklist

1. Pick a section.
2. Run each `[ ]` item in the real bot; tick it ✅ with a date.
3. Report findings as "**X should be Y / X is currently Z**" — each becomes a
   diagnosis target.
4. When a new feature ships, add its surface here **in the same PR** (treat it
   as part of done).

## § 1 — Economy & Inventory

> Machine coverage: `test_economy_log_channel_pipeline` tests the log-channel
> pipeline only; **the user-facing economy commands have no behavioral tests**.

---

## § 4 — Roles & Reaction Roles

> Machine coverage: `test_role_cog_routing.py` tests routing logic only;
> the full panel flow and role-assignment behavior are unverified.

  Time Roles · XP Roles · Reaction · Diagnostics · Exemptions.

  auto-assign rules).

- `[ ]` `!rolecreator` — **Expect:** a role-creation flow (guided or modal).

### 4.2 Reaction roles

### 4.3 XP-gated and time-gated roles

- `[ ]` Confirm that roles auto-assign at the configured XP thresholds (check
  `!rolesettings` for the thresholds; award XP manually via `!givexp` and
  watch the member's roles). **Roles the task loop assigns may have a < 10-min
  delay** — note the lag, not a bug unless it never fires.
- `[ ]` Confirm time-gated roles assign after the configured membership duration
  (hard to verify in a short session; just confirm the task loop is registered
  and `!diagnostics` reports it running).

---

## § 5 — XP System

> Machine coverage: `test_xp_cog_admin_routes`, `test_xp_cog_caching`,
> `test_xp_listener_roles`, `test_xp_participation_gate` — internal behavior
> tested; **embed quality and rank-card image unverified**.

  correctly, including leaderboard position.
- `[ ]` `!xpconfig` — **Expect:** the XP configuration panel (rate, exclusions,
  etc.) renders with current values.
- `[ ]` Level-up announcement: send several messages to trigger a level-up;
  **Expect:** a level-up announcement in the configured channel (or DM). Pairs
  with Community Spotlight (already verified in production eval Tier 5).

---

## § 6 — Moderation

> Machine coverage: `test_moderation_panel_embed`, `test_moderation_role_authority`,
> `test_moderation_schemas` — embed/schema tests only; **command execution
> (warn/timeout/kick/ban) has never been live-tested**.
>
> ⚠️ Moderation commands are irreversible on real members — use a test account
> or a dedicated test server.

- `[ ]` `!modmenu` — **Expect:** the Moderation hub panel with action buttons.
  Slash `/moderation` also opens it.
- `[ ]` `!warn @testuser reason text` — **Expect:** a warning embed sent to

## § 7 — Channel Management

> Machine coverage: `test_channel_list_paginate` — pagination only; channel
> mutations are untested.

- `[ ]` `!lock #channel-name` — **Expect:** the channel goes read-only for
  regular members; a "locked" message appears.
- `[ ]` `!unlock #channel-name` — **Expect:** permissions restored; confirm
  members can post again.
- `[ ]` Channel list commands (the channel management panel) — navigate to
  channel list; pagination works past 25 channels if the server has them.
- `[ ]` Channel-creation/deletion flows (if exposed via `!channel` subcommands)
  — create a throwaway channel, then delete it.

---

## § 8 — Word Filter (Cleanup subsystem)

  message.
- `[ ]` `!toggle_reset_on_wrong_count` — **Expect:** wrong-number reset
  behavior toggled; confirm the setting persists.

---

## § 10 — Admin & Operator

> Machine coverage: `test_admin_cog_manager`, `test_admin_menu_integration`,

- `[ ]` `!slashes` — **Expect:** a list of all registered slash commands.
- `[ ]` `!restart` — **Expect:** bot sends a "restarting" message, goes
  offline, comes back (exit-42 contract, PR #675 + the new 429-backoff, PR
  #729). **Already in production eval Step 0 — re-verify if in doubt.**
- `[ ]` `!loglevel DEBUG` / `!loglevel INFO` — **Expect:** log level changes
  live without restart; subsequent log output reflects the new level.

---

## § 11 — Diagnostic commands

> Machine coverage: `test_diagnostic_consistency_embed`, `test_diagnostic_panels_data`,
> `test_platform_flags_embed`, `test_platform_health_embed`,

- `[ ]` `!logging` — **Expect:** the Logging panel with current channel
  bindings and event-type toggles.
- `[ ]` Bind a log channel (Settings → Logging or via the panel) → perform
  a moderation action → **Expect:** the action appears in the bound log
  channel within seconds.
- `[ ]` Toggle a log event type off → perform the action → **Expect:** no log
  entry for that type.

---

## § 13 — BTD6 Reference, Strategy & Paragon

> Machine coverage: many `test_btd6_*` tests cover the core BTD6 cog;

---

## § 14 — Deathmatch

> Machine coverage: `test_deathmatch_bot_duel`, `test_deathmatch_combat_stats`,
> `test_deathmatch_gear_wear`, `test_deathmatch_guild_scope` — internal combat
> math tested; **the interactive duel flow requires two participants**.

> Production eval Tier 4.3 walked the top-level hub; the sub-panels inside
> it have not been individually verified.

  mute-role settings.
- `[ ]` **📺 Channels** subpanel — channel list, create/delete flows.
- `[ ]` **🎭 Roles** subpanel — delegates to the Roles hub (§4 above).
- `[ ]` **🧹 Cleanup** subpanel — delegates to the Cleanup panel (§8 above).
- `[ ]` **🧩 Setup** subpanel — opens the Setup wizard or its settings-entry
  view; confirm it doesn't re-run a completed wizard from scratch.

---

## § 17 — Bootstrap / Access Management

> Machine coverage: `test_bootstrap_access_cog.py`,
> `test_bootstrap_access_reload.py` — bootstrap guard tests; **the actual
> access-grant flow for a new server is never live-tested post-setup**.

- `[ ]` Confirm the bootstrap cog **does not** expose a button or command to
  regular members (it should be invisible until an owner-tier principal is
  detected at boot).
- `[ ]` After a fresh server join: the onboarding flow initiates cleanly
  (Setup wizard starts or an appropriate prompt appears).
- `[ ]` Access Map (`!servermanagement` → **🔓 Access Map**) — already in
  production eval Tier 4.3; confirm the access tier simulation still works
  as of the most recent deploy.

---

## Maintenance instructions

- **When a feature ships:** add its test surface to the relevant section with
  `[ ]` status in the same PR. Never let a surface ship without an entry here.
- **When a surface is walked:** update its badge to ✅ with `(date, PR #NNN or
  "live walk YYYY-MM-DD")`.
- **When a surface is removed:** delete its entry and note the removal at the
  bottom of its section.
- **When this doc drifts from source:** source wins. Verify live before trusting
  a ✅ that is more than 3 months old.
