# docs/ideas — the idea backlog & lifecycle

> **Status:** `ideas`. **Nothing here is approved for implementation.** These are
> capture docs so ideas live in the repo instead of in chat. Source code, the
> binding contracts, and `docs/current-state.md` always win over anything here.
>
> **This folder is a conveyor, not a graveyard.** The maintainer drops ideas in *any
> order, any time*; agents capture them, route each to a reasonable home, and keep the
> backlog moving so **every idea eventually becomes _implemented_ or _discussed_** (or
> explicitly _rejected_). Grooming this backlog is also the standing **secondary task** —
> what an agent does with leftover capacity once its main work + PR are done (see §
> "Backlog grooming").

## What lives here

Pure brainstorm backlogs — capture without commitment. Each file should carry an
`ideas` badge in its header and state what it is *not* (not a plan, not approval).

Current broad captures:

- [`bot-self-test-walker-2026-06-10.md`](./bot-self-test-walker-2026-06-10.md) —
  owner idea (brainstorm round 3): **the bot tests itself** — an owner-gated
  in-process walker that synthetically invokes every ledger-listed command
  (EventBus as witness, governance audience simulation, scratch test guild)
  + an AI eval mode running scripted prompts through the real pipeline
  (Q-0086 keys). Pairs with the commissioned untested-surface testing
  checklist; candidate probe set for the workflow-§10 Stage 1 caretaker.
- [`superbot-vision-2026-06-10.md`](./superbot-vision-2026-06-10.md) — the
  maintainer's written **product vision statement** (2-minute setup, panel
  navigation doctrine, 4-button help home, per-user preferences, RPG
  difficulty/survival/energy design, story pets, AI-as-panel-orchestrator) +
  the agent's creative response (AG-01…AG-15), dedup-mapped against every
  existing capture/plan/decision, with flagged tensions (T-1…T-5) and a routing
  ledger. **Newest owner-voice capture — read alongside the 2026-06-08 one.**
- [`fun-and-ease-brainstorm-2026-06-09.md`](./fun-and-ease-brainstorm-2026-06-09.md) —
  24 dedup-verified new ideas for "more fun + easier to use" (social/competition layer,
  ambient delight, member UX), each grep-checked against docs *and* source before
  capture. Owner cluster picks recorded (Q-0053): **pets & companions** (structured →
  [`../planning/pets-companions-plan-2026-06-09.md`](../planning/pets-companions-plan-2026-06-09.md)),
  context-menu actions, persistent reminders.
- [`cog-improvement-audit-2026-06-08.md`](./cog-improvement-audit-2026-06-08.md) —
  cog-by-cog improvement audit from a 36-question interactive session (2026-06-08).
  Covers all 35 existing cogs; includes a priority-ranked routing table. Top finding:
  setup wizard is P0 (half its steps do nothing); AI cog settings and RPS tournament
  decoupling are next.
- [`owner-vision-ideas-2026-06-08.md`](./owner-vision-ideas-2026-06-08.md) —
  20-question interactive session with the maintainer (2026-06-08); covers games
  (poker, idle), economy (marketplace, streaks), AI (dungeon master, NL, events),
  social (guilds, achievements, profiles), integrations (Twitch, YouTube, Spotify,
  Steam), and UX priorities. Includes a routing summary table. **Start here for
  the most up-to-date owner preferences.**
- [`future-product-direction-2026-06-07.md`](./future-product-direction-2026-06-07.md) —
  source-aware future product direction across polish, extensions, reusable systems,
  and long-term expansions; capture-only, not a roadmap.
- [`settings-presets-and-ai-template-advisor.md`](./settings-presets-and-ai-template-advisor.md) —
  the **Q-0070 presets-everywhere posture** (decided — routed to settings-audit
  Phase 4) + the **AI template/preset advisor** idea (modular prompt designs/styles
  as AI-cog settings so the AI can suggest the right template per task; captured
  only, gated).
- [`ai-extra-tool-capability-ideas.md`](./ai-extra-tool-capability-ideas.md) — AI
  extra-tool capability backlog (capture only, not approved work).
- [`mining_exploration_brainstorm.md`](./mining_exploration_brainstorm.md) — design-intent
  for the mining subsystem, referenced by `disbot/cogs/mining/exploration.py`.

Related idea-shaped docs that live elsewhere **by design**:

- `docs/planning/superbot-ideas-lab-2026-06-05.md` — brainstorm backlog, **but** its
  §2 (operating decisions) and §6 (rejection ledger) are **binding** "do-not-propose"
  — so it stays in `planning/`, not here.

## The idea lifecycle

```text
(1) INTAKE      maintainer drops an idea, any time, any order
      ↓         → capture it in docs/ideas/<topic>.md (state: raw → captured)
(2) MAP         name the owning subsystem, rough size, rough risk
      ↓
(3) ROUTE       send it to ONE reasonable home:
      ├─ small + safe + in an active lane → quick-win (execute now or next session)
      ├─ clear direction, bigger          → structured plan in docs/planning/ + a
      │                                      horizon on docs/roadmap.md (Now/Next/Later/Someday)
      └─ excessive / ambiguous / product  → DISCUSS FIRST: a Q-block in
                                             docs/owner/maintainer-question-router.md
(4) GROOM       leftover-capacity work: pull one routable idea forward (see below)
      ↓
(5) OUTCOME     every idea ends as exactly one of:
                implemented · on the roadmap at a horizon · in discussion (router) · rejected
```

**Routing rule — never auto-promote.** An idea is *captured and routed*, not promoted to
active work, unless the maintainer says so or it exposes a blocker / safety / architecture
conflict (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` Working agreement; `docs/collaboration-model.md`). Routing
just gives every idea a **state** and a **next destination** so none sits at `raw`.

**"Discuss if excessive."** If an idea is large, ambiguous, or a product-vision call,
the right route is a router Q-block — not silent promotion and not silent drop. The
maintainer's answer then sends it back onto this lifecycle (roadmap horizon, plan, or the
rejection ledger).

## Promotion gates (idea → implementation plan)

An idea may graduate to an implementation plan only after **all** of:

1. **Ownership** — the owning service / cog / pipeline is identified (`docs/ownership.md`).
2. **Reuse check** — existing service/helper/abstraction reuse is confirmed; no
   duplicate systems (`docs/helper-policy.md`).
3. **Risk review** — privacy, security/permissions, cost, and moderation risk reviewed.
4. **Mechanics** — migration / cache / test / rollback needs are listed.
5. **Promotion** — `docs/current-state.md` marks it an active candidate (and/or it lands
   on `docs/roadmap.md` at a horizon).

> (`raw → captured → … → shipped`, see
> [`../owner/ai-project-workflow.md`](../owner/ai-project-workflow.md) §5) are just words
> for an idea's position on *this* lifecycle plus the question-router question-lifecycle.
> This README owns the `captured → ready-for-planning → shipped` gates; the workflow doc
> references them — it does **not** define a parallel tracker.

## Backlog grooming (the standing secondary task)

So an agent **always has a next thing to do** — and so the backlog actually drains — every
session ends with a grooming pass once the main task + PR are done and capacity remains:

1. **Browse** `docs/ideas/` (and any new ideas the maintainer dropped this session).
2. **Pick one** routable idea and move it *one step* down the lifecycle:
   - **Execute it now** if it is small, safe, reversible, and in an already-decided lane
     (this is real work, not scope creep — `docs/collaboration-model.md` act-vs-ask).
   - **Structure it into a plan** for the next agent (`docs/planning/…`) + place it on
     `docs/roadmap.md` at a horizon, if the direction is clear but the work is bigger.
   - **Open a discussion** (router Q-block) if it is excessive / ambiguous / a product call.
3. **Record** the move: update the idea's state, and note the grooming in the `.sessions/`
   log so the next agent sees the backlog is live.

A **periodic sweep** (the `.session-journal.md` REVIEW cadence) confirms no idea is stuck
at `raw`/`captured` with no destination — that is the no-orphan guarantee, made checkable.

## Routed planning pass — 2026-06-08

The current cross-source lifecycle outcomes are recorded in
[`../planning/idea-roadmap-inventory-2026-06-08.md`](../planning/idea-roadmap-inventory-2026-06-08.md).
That ledger groups ideas by canonical subsystem/platform seam and links the resulting roadmap drafts; it does not approve implementation or replace the preserved capture docs above.
