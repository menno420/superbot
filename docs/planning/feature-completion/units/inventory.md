# Inventory — completion certificate

> **Status:** `living-ledger` — per-unit completion certificate; updated as the unit is assessed /
> certified. Source + merged PRs win. System: [`../README.md`](../README.md).

> **Unit:** `inventory` · **Type:** server-fn · **Family:** economy
> **State:** ◐ assessed · **Assessed:** 2026-06-29 · **Certified:** —

> Assessed during the completion-first arc (Q-0209). Inventory is a **read-only unified item browser**:
> it merges the economy item table and the mining inventory, groups by category (`ITEM_CATALOGUE`),
> paginates (8/page) and sorts by rarity. Writes happen **upstream** (mining/shop/crafting workflows,
> which audit their *coin* leg via `EVT_BALANCE_CHANGED`); the inventory unit itself performs no
> mutations. The honest gaps are real and shape the punch-list: declared mutation capabilities
> (`inventory.item.use`, `inventory.craft.recipe`) are **aspirational / unenforced**, item-grant has
> **no `audit.action_recorded`**, there is **no server configuration**, and tests cover only the
> navigation lifecycle (not the display/sort logic). This is a clean Phase-1 read-only unit; use/sell/
> trade/gift + audit + config are explicitly future work.

## Rubric (server function)

### A. Functional completeness
- [x] **Core promise (view items)** — `_build_combined_inventory` merges mining + economy items, grouped
      + rarity-sorted; empty state guides to `!mine`/`!shop`.
- [ ] **Every best-in-class sub-option** — ❌ **read-only.** No use/equip/sell/trade/gift actions exist;
      no sort/filter UI beyond the fixed category+rarity order. → punch #1/#5.
- [x] **Failure modes honest** — empty inventory message is accurate; reads can't fail destructively.
- [x] **Idempotent** — pure reads (no view-layer writes; pinned by `test_no_view_level_purchase_writes`).

### B. Reachability & UI
- [x] **A command panel exists** — `!inventory`/`!inv` → `UnifiedInventoryView` (category buttons →
      paginated `_CategoryView`); Economy-hub 🎒 button (`economy:inventory`).
- [x] **Reachable every natural way** — command + Economy-hub button + `build_help_menu_view` hook.
- [N/A] **Integrated into Setup** — items are earned via mining/shop; nothing to configure at onboarding.
- [x] **Return navigation** — `_CategoryView` Back → hub; Economy path attaches back-to-economy.
- [x] **In-place, not spammy** — command uses `send_panel`; the Economy button edits in place.

### C. Convenience
- [x] **Pagination** — 8 items/page with boundary-disabled nav; hub previews first 3 + count per category.
- [ ] **Sort/filter** — ❌ no name/qty/rarity sort or type filter; fixed order only. → punch #5.
- [x] **Clear feedback** — empty state + page footer; ⚠ item-detail line is dense (emoji·name·qty·rarity·
      type on one line) — readability degrades for large inventories. → punch #4.

### D. Authority & safety
- [x] **Authority re-checked at callback** — view ownership enforced by `BaseView.interaction_check`
      (read-only; no capability gate needed for a self-view).
- [ ] **All mutations through the audited seam** — ⚠ **N/A here, but a gap upstream:** the inventory unit
      writes nothing; however the item-grant primitives (`utils/db/inventory.add_item` / mining
      `apply_inventory_deltas`) do **not** call `emit_audit_action` — only the coin leg is audited
      (`EVT_BALANCE_CHANGED`). The item trail is incomplete. → punch #2.
- [N/A] **Provisioning pipeline** — no resource creation.
- [ ] **Reuses governance** — capabilities `inventory.item.view/use` + `inventory.craft.recipe` are
      **declared but unenforced** (the read view has no capability check beyond user-tier visibility).
      → punch #3.

### E. Configuration
- [ ] **Settings pipeline** — ❌ **no `inventory` schema.** `ITEM_CATALOGUE` is hardcoded; no per-guild
      enable/disable/rename. → punch #6. (Arguably correct for a global item model — flagged, not faulted.)
- [N/A] **config-input widgets** — no server-level config surface.
- [N/A] **Everything configurable that should be** — pending the #6 decision (is per-guild config wanted?).

### F. Wiring & discoverability
- [x] **Registry** — key `inventory`, `category: economy`, `visibility_tier: user`,
      `parent_hub: economy`, entry `inventory`, depends on economy, capabilities declared (see #3).
- [x] **Discoverable in Help** — `build_help_menu_view` hook; surfaced as an Economy child.

### G. Tests & evidence (required for ✔)
- [ ] **Behavior tests** — ⚠ only the navigation lifecycle is tested
      (`test_economy_inventory_edit.py`); `_build_combined_inventory`/`_CategoryView.build_embed`/rarity
      sort/pagination boundaries are **untested**. → punch #7.
- [x] **Authority tests** — view ownership via `BaseView` (inherited; no inventory-specific test).
- [N/A] **Mutation-seam tests** — no mutations in this unit (upstream workflows tested separately).
- [ ] **Live walkthrough recorded** — pending → punch #8.
- [ ] **Owner ✔** — pending → punch #9.

## Punch-list (clear these to certify)
1. **Item actions** *(owner, deepening)* — decide + build use / sell / trade / gift / equip (today the
   browser is read-only). Biggest completeness gap.
2. **Audit item grants** *(offline/owner, deepening)* — have `add_item` / mining `apply_inventory_deltas`
   emit an item-grant audit event so the item trail matches the coin trail.
3. **Capability enforcement** *(owner, minor)* — either enforce the declared `inventory.*` capabilities or
   remove the aspirational ones from the registry until their features exist.
4. **Item-detail density** *(offline, minor)* — multi-line / dedicated fields for large inventories.
5. **Sort / filter UI** *(offline, deepening)* — sort by qty/name/rarity, filter by type.
6. **Server configuration** *(owner, minor)* — decide whether items should be per-guild configurable; if
   so, add a SubsystemSchema.
7. **Display-logic tests** *(offline, minor)* — cover the merge/sort/pagination/empty paths.
8. **Live walkthrough** *(owner / live-bot)* — `/verify-bot` boot + click-through (hub → category → page →
   back), with screenshots.
9. **Owner sign-off** — maintainer confirms "it does its job the most convenient way."

## Evidence
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/views/test_economy_inventory_edit.py` (navigation lifecycle) ·
  `tests/unit/invariants/test_no_view_level_purchase_writes.py`
- **Walkthrough:** pending (punch #8)
- **Owner sign-off:** pending (punch #9)

## Verdict
Inventory is a **correct, well-routed read-only item browser** (unified mining+economy view, paginated,
rarity-sorted, reachable via command/hub/Help). It is **the least mature** server-fn assessed so far on
the *ceiling* axis: it deliberately ships no item actions, item grants are unaudited upstream, the
declared mutation capabilities are unenforced placeholders, there is no server config, and only the
navigation lifecycle is tested. None of this is a safety hazard (it's read-only), but a `◐ → ✔` path
needs an owner decision on item actions + audit + capability cleanup (#1–#3) before it is "done-done."
