## Executive summary

### Live/baseline delta and enumeration

* Live GitHub on 2026-06-10 shows open PRs **#638, #640, #641, and #642**. PR **#639 merged on 2026-06-09 at 23:55:54 UTC**, so the standard's §2.4 AI-internals carve-out is now a merged-baseline delta, not an in-flight PR. This is the §5.7 stop-condition delta; it does not prevent surface mapping, and AI tool/catalogue/instruction internals remain descriptive-only here.
* The binding standard itself is open in #641 and absent from this branch. This mapping imports that exact file and changes only Agent B's pre-allocated §5.5 line, as required.
* Registry enumeration re-confirmed **36 loaded extensions, 29 subsystems, and 10 mother hubs**. Agent B covers 12 subsystem cogs, two loaded-cog-only surfaces, and composition architecture. AST decorator enumeration found **157 command records** in those 14 cogs (including prefix/slash group children; bootstrap has none). See the verification log for the exact commands.

### Severity-ranked findings

FIND-B01 [2 important improvement] Help render paths apply materially different filters; direct hub/subsystem/single-command paths do not consume effective access projection.
  evidence: disbot/cogs/help/route.py:240-330 · `open_route`; docs/planning/help-cog-customization-audit-2026-06-09.md:94-106 · source-verified filter audit
  verified-by: read source + `grep 'resolve_route|open_route|project_access_map'`
  verdict: blocked-by-gate(Adaptive P1C)

FIND-B02 [2 important improvement] Settings hub display/reachability remains a known current-state gap, but live PR #640 owns it.
  evidence: docs/planning/settings-cog-centralization-audit-2026-06-09.md:204-219 · display audit; disbot/views/settings/hub.py:1 · current implementation
  verified-by: read audit + live GitHub PR #640 file list
  verdict: blocked-by-gate(Lane 7)

FIND-B03 [2 important improvement] Admin's subsystem metadata is owner-tier while `!adminmenu`, `/admin`, and the Admin hub admit administrators, producing a placement/visibility mismatch.
  evidence: disbot/utils/subsystem_registry.py:59-83 · `visibility_tier="owner"`; disbot/cogs/admin_cog.py:34-69 · administrator checks; disbot/utils/hub_registry.py:239-250 · Admin hub administrator floor
  verified-by: read source + registry enumeration
  verdict: needs-owner-decision (Q-B01)

FIND-B04 [2 important improvement] Many panel actions and intentionally hidden typed shortcuts retain the ledger default `primary_entrypoint`, so the composition layer cannot accurately characterize the surface without Discord `hidden` and curated-list side channels.
  evidence: disbot/core/runtime/command_surface_ledger.py:103-107 · default classification; disbot/cogs/role_cog.py:369-498 · hidden panel shortcuts; disbot/services/customization_catalogue.py:67-90 · curated panel list
  verified-by: AST decorator enumeration + read source
  verdict: reorganize

FIND-B05 [2 important improvement] Governance has no setup section; this is an acknowledged deferred gap rather than implementable mapping-session work.
  evidence: docs/planning/settings-cog-centralization-audit-2026-06-09.md:277-289 · setup/governance overlap; docs/planning/server-management-status-2026-06-05.md:693-707 · remaining queue
  verified-by: read authoritative trackers + setup-section file enumeration
  verdict: blocked-by-gate(Q-0008/Q-0011)

FIND-B06 [2 important improvement] Top-level channel commands use globally generic names (`set`, `create`, `list`, `move`, `lock`, `unlock`, `rename`, `permissions`) rather than a grouped namespace.
  evidence: disbot/cogs/channel_cog.py:163-517 · command decorators
  verified-by: AST decorator enumeration
  verdict: needs-owner-decision (Q-B02)

FIND-B07 [3 cleanup] Setup exposes `/setup-hub` as explicitly legacy compatibility UI but the ledger has no slash classification wiring and therefore cannot mark it `legacy_duplicate`.
  evidence: disbot/cogs/setup_cog.py:113-170 · `/setup-hub` legacy description; disbot/core/runtime/command_surface_ledger.py:331-384 · slash entries default classification
  verified-by: read source
  verdict: hide-legacy

FIND-B08 [3 cleanup] Help-map count reconciliation and render-path characterization are not yet on this branch; live PR #642 owns both.
  evidence: docs/planning/multi-lane-execution-plan-2026-06-09.md:206-229 · Lane 8; disbot/cogs/help_cog.py:592-759 · five shared route call sites
  verified-by: live GitHub PR #642 file list + read source
  verdict: blocked-by-gate(Lane 8)

FIND-B09 [3 cleanup] AI tool registry/catalogue/instruction-stack internals changed with merged #639 after the standard's pinned baseline.
  evidence: disbot/services/ai_tools.py:1 · tool registry; disbot/services/ai_tool_catalogue.py:1 · catalogue; disbot/services/ai_introspection_service.py:1 · merged read model

#### Per-cog quality checklist

1. **Right hub/tier?** Yes, except explicit findings. 2. **Useful commands discoverable?** Panel entrypoints are; hidden/power shortcuts rely on typed/panel flows and classification needs FIND-B04. 3. **Merge/hide?** Only `/setup-hub` is an explicit hide-legacy candidate. 4. **Wrong subsystem?** None established. 5. **Service overlap?** Composition is intentional; no merger recommended. 6. **Components consistent?** Generally yes; domain selectors remain canonical. 7. **Dynamic and permission-safe?** Resource workflows resolve live guild resources and command/callback checks. 8. **Names clear?** Mostly; FIND-B06 identifies channel ambiguity. 9. **Missing actions?** None promoted; see Future opportunities. 10. **Gate-consistent?** Yes. 11. **Implementation vs future?** Implementation session handles unblocked findings; gated work stays with its named lane.

#### Panel/view record

1. **view** — SettingsHubView — `views/settings/hub.py`.
2. **entry** — command table entrypoint/help hook or parent-panel button.
3. **preset** — closest preset is `Platform Manager Panel`; current shape generally conforms, subject to listed findings.
4. **components** — source-owned buttons/selects/modals; guild resources are selected dynamically in role/channel/settings/setup flows.
5. **navigation** — shared HubView/PersistentView/navigation helpers where the panel exists; Help and setup preserve anchors; no panel for bootstrap admission.
6. **lifecycle_safety** — mutating domain panels re-check authority through command/callback/service seams; callback deferral and terminal-state behavior remain area-test concerns.
7. **multiselect_fit** — existing selectors are appropriate; no new conversion is recommended by this mapping.
8. **copy_consistency** — copy matches the current command family except explicit legacy/setup and naming findings.
9. **visibility** — open-time tier checks exist; Help's effective-access mismatch is FIND-B01.
10. **reuse** — shared panel bases/selectors are used except legacy/local paginator primitives noted by source; no runtime change proposed.
11. **consistency_gaps** — see the subsystem's `gaps_risks` and executive findings.

5. **help_routes** — Direct typed resolution uses `cogs/help/route.py`; Home/Advanced placement follows hub/subsystem metadata. Loaded-cog-only surfaces have no subsystem route.
6. **panel_entry** — `views/diagnostic/*`; catalogue detection is help-hook and/or curated `KNOWN_PANEL_COMMANDS` where applicable.
7. **settings_setup_routes** — Current settings/setup state is described by the settings audit; domain panels stay canonical and are linked rather than absorbed.
8. **governance_access** — intended tier `administrator`; execution remains protected by command checks, governance/callback checks, and central admission where applicable.
9. **placement_tier** — `top_level`; current placement is intentional except where a finding above says otherwise.
10. **overlap** — Server-management/settings/help compose this surface but do not own its domain mutation seams.
11. **protections** — `tests/unit/cogs/`, `tests/unit/views/`, `tests/unit/services/`, and `tests/unit/invariants/` area tests; registry/help/settings audits supply documentation pins.
12. **gaps_risks** — Applicable executive findings: none beyond composition findings.

#### Panel/view record

1. **view** — AIPlatformPanelView + `views/ai/*`.
2. **entry** — command table entrypoint/help hook or parent-panel button.
3. **preset** — closest preset is `Platform Manager Panel`; current shape generally conforms, subject to listed findings.
4. **components** — source-owned buttons/selects/modals; guild resources are selected dynamically in role/channel/settings/setup flows.
5. **navigation** — shared HubView/PersistentView/navigation helpers where the panel exists; Help and setup preserve anchors; no panel for bootstrap admission.
6. **lifecycle_safety** — mutating domain panels re-check authority through command/callback/service seams; callback deferral and terminal-state behavior remain area-test concerns.
7. **multiselect_fit** — existing selectors are appropriate; no new conversion is recommended by this mapping.
8. **copy_consistency** — copy matches the current command family except explicit legacy/setup and naming findings.
9. **visibility** — open-time tier checks exist; Help's effective-access mismatch is FIND-B01.
10. **reuse** — shared panel bases/selectors are used except legacy/local paginator primitives noted by source; no runtime change proposed.
11. **consistency_gaps** — see the subsystem's `gaps_risks` and executive findings.

#### Per-cog quality checklist

1. **Right hub/tier?** Yes, except explicit findings. 2. **Useful commands discoverable?** Panel entrypoints are; hidden/power shortcuts rely on typed/panel flows and classification needs FIND-B04. 3. **Merge/hide?** Only `/setup-hub` is an explicit hide-legacy candidate. 4. **Wrong subsystem?** None established. 5. **Service overlap?** Composition is intentional; no merger recommended. 6. **Components consistent?** Generally yes; domain selectors remain canonical. 7. **Dynamic and permission-safe?** Resource workflows resolve live guild resources and command/callback checks. 8. **Names clear?** Mostly; FIND-B06 identifies channel ambiguity. 9. **Missing actions?** None promoted; see Future opportunities. 10. **Gate-consistent?** Yes. 11. **Implementation vs future?** Implementation session handles unblocked findings; gated work stays with its named lane.

## setup

### Subsystem record

1. **subsystem_key** — `none — loaded cog only`.
2. **owning_cog** — `disbot/cogs/setup_cog.py`.
3. **owning_services** — `disbot/services/setup_sections.py`; see service records below.
4. **hub_placement** — none — loaded cog only; linked from server-management/setup flows.
5. **help_routes** — Direct typed resolution uses `cogs/help/route.py`; Home/Advanced placement follows hub/subsystem metadata. Loaded-cog-only surfaces have no subsystem route.
6. **panel_entry** — Setup wizard views — `views/setup/*`; catalogue detection is help-hook and/or curated `KNOWN_PANEL_COMMANDS` where applicable.
7. **settings_setup_routes** — Current settings/setup state is described by the settings audit; domain panels stay canonical and are linked rather than absorbed.
8. **governance_access** — intended tier `administrator/delegated setup admin`; execution remains protected by command checks, governance/callback checks, and central admission where applicable.
9. **placement_tier** — `legacy`; current placement is intentional except where a finding above says otherwise.
10. **overlap** — Server-management/settings/help compose this surface but do not own its domain mutation seams.
11. **protections** — `tests/unit/cogs/`, `tests/unit/views/`, `tests/unit/services/`, and `tests/unit/invariants/` area tests; registry/help/settings audits supply documentation pins.
12. **gaps_risks** — Applicable executive findings: FIND-B05, FIND-B07.

## Composition architecture

### §3.4-style composition records

| service | owner_of | consumers | mutation | bypasses | overlap | cache_events | observability | tests | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `disbot/cogs/help_cog.py` + `disbot/cogs/help/route.py` | Help rendering, shared route resolution/opening | prefix/slash Help + dropdown | read-only | direct render paths bypass projection (FIND-B01) | dedicated cog panels | none | fallback logging | `tests/unit/cogs/test_help*` | blocked-by-gate(Adaptive P1C/Lane 8) |

### Help filter-by-render-path matrix — delta since #627

No source change to Help rendering occurred between audit #627 and HEAD. Merged #639 changed AI internals only; live #642 proposes characterization tests but is not merged. Therefore the matrix delta is **none**, while ownership/status changed to `blocked-by-gate(Lane 8|Adaptive P1C)`.

| Help render path | live cog/enabled/Discord-hidden | ledger hidden/legacy | member tier | governance visibility | command routing | command access | capability/can-run | delta since #627 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home overview/hub buttons | partial/live static hub list | no | yes, hub floor | no | no | no | no | none |
| Advanced subsystem browser | live registered subsystems | generic command embed only | yes | yes | no | no | no | none |
| Typed/dropdown hub route | live builder/fallback | builder-dependent | route/open context only | no target authorization | no | no | callback/command only | none |
| Typed/dropdown subsystem route | live cog required | fallback generic embed yes; dedicated hook varies | no consistent target authorization | no | no | no | callback/command only | none |
| Single-command route | live command lookup | no | no | no | no | no | no `can_run` | none |

## Cross-boundary observations

* Agent A subsystems inherit FIND-B01/FIND-B04 composition behavior, but their commands/panels are intentionally not mapped here. Evidence: `disbot/cogs/help/route.py:302-330`, `disbot/core/runtime/command_surface_ledger.py:251-264`.
* `role` is owned by Agent B but is a primary child of Agent A's `community` hub; this is intentional cross-boundary navigation, not shared subsystem ownership. Evidence: `disbot/utils/subsystem_registry.py:235-259`, `disbot/utils/hub_registry.py:206-218`.

## Future opportunities

FIND-B10 [4 future opportunity] After existing gates/lanes settle, consider a generated operator-facing explanation of why a command is visible but unavailable, derived only from the canonical access projection.

  verdict: future-opportunity

## Open owner questions

### Q-B01 — Admin tier alignment

Which contract should win? **A.** Make registry/Admin Help placement administrator-visible while retaining owner-only checks for dangerous actions; **B.** make the entire Admin panel owner-only; **C.** keep the mismatch intentionally and document it. Proposed: **A**.

### Q-B02 — Channel command namespace

How should globally generic channel commands evolve? **A.** preserve typed compatibility but add a `channel` group and classify old names hidden legacy; **B.** retain current top-level names; **C.** panel-first only, with old names hidden legacy. Proposed: **A**.

## Verification log

* Read the binding standard imported from live PR #641, both cornerstone audits, current-state, all requested maps/folios/trackers, and the relevant source.
* Live GitHub API: open PRs #638/#640/#641/#642; #639 merged at `2026-06-09T23:55:54Z`. `gh` is unavailable and there is no git remote, so API/raw GitHub were used.
* `python3.10` was not directly usable (inactive shim; activating 3.10.20 lacked `yaml`); substituted Python **3.12.13** through a temporary `python3.10` wrapper, per the standard.
* Ran `python scripts/context_map.py <path>` for 22 deeply inspected files: the 14 scoped cogs/help route, both registries, ledger, catalogue, access projection, routing, and command access.
* AST enumeration command: `python /tmp/gen_tables.py` — 157 scoped command rows: admin 10, moderation 9, cleanup 7, logging 6, proof_channel 5, role 14, channel 15, server_management 2, settings 3, diagnostic 47, help 2, ai 22, setup 10, bootstrap_access 0.
* Registry enumeration command: `PYTHONPATH=disbot python - <<'PY' ... SUBSYSTEMS/HUBS ... PY` — re-confirmed scoped tiers/parents and the 10 hubs.
* Final checks: strict docs reports only the two expected open-#641 reachability orphans; full quality passes black/isort/ruff/mypy and 8,457 tests, with only the same doc-orphan pin failing. Details are in the session log and PR test plan.
