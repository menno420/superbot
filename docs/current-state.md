> **▶ NEXT (live — read THIS line): the buildable `ready` decade-queue is consumed — next buildable work is PLAN-FIRST *or* the dashboard lane.** **Dashboard handoff (2026-06-16, #969):** the developer-dashboard **Phase 3 env-usage map shipped** — `scripts/scan_env_usage.py` (stdlib AST scan: each env var → file/line, required/optional, layer; names + locations only, never values), surfaced on the new dashboard `/env` page + the generated `docs/operations/env-vars.md` reference. **Dashboard read-only surfaces are now ALL shipped (2026-06-16):** the Q-0156 read-only lane is consumed — `/status` (build & health, **#985**) was the last one, after `/aliases` (#982) + `/games` (#983). **Next dashboard slices are all gated:** the owner-approved **live help/panel editor** (Q-0156, the headline ask) needs the private bot control API + Discord OAuth design (see `planning/dashboard-live-editor-plan.md` L0–L3); Phase 2 (owner auth · checklist · public bug form) and Phase 4 (control board) need owner decisions first (auth method + DB — the plan's open questions); Phase 3b *value-management* needs the Railway-API integration (`creds`). So the dashboard's next pure-code slice is **owner/creds-gated** — the remaining `ready`-class buildable lanes stay the **PLAN-FIRST** ones below. **(2026-06-17, #1017): the settings global tier shipped** — `resolve_setting` now does per-guild → global (`guild_id=0`) → default and `SettingsMutationPipeline.set_value` has an owner-gated `scope="global"` path; the dashboard settings lane's **phase ③** (web editor + `POST /control/settings/{scope}` with the Global/per-server scope picker) is the named next slice but is **owner-pacing-gated** (control-API write endpoints = the owner's "don't rush" zone, needs the Railway `CONTROL_API_TOKEN`) — a future empty fire should take a different ungated lane until the owner greenlights it. The `/myprofile` lane is **buildable-complete**: PR A (read-only card, **#938**) + **PR B — self-service writes (shipped #940)** — `views/profile/editor.py`, the first UI consumer of `ParticipationMutationPipeline` (participation opt-in/out · subscription toggles · visibility toggle · preference editors bool/enum/modal; each action exactly one audited pipeline call). The only remaining myprofile slice is **PR C (join-time onboarding), owner-gated → routed as router Q-0147** (may a public bot DM strangers? — agent recommends in-guild / opt-in / no unsolicited DM). The games-economy faucet/sink diagnostic (slot 2) **shipped #937**. **So the next ▶ startable = a PLAN-FIRST slice: own a small plan for ONE of** — image moderation (Q-0108) · the AI §7 next workflow family (post-prod-check) · the Hermes bug-triage `gh issue create` write (Q-0121); **security service tiers 1+2 (#929) is owner/Hermes-review**, BUG-0009 newest-towers is `data`-gated, absence-guard Layer B is `creds`-gated. **Note:** the `diagnostic_cog.py` 800-LOC blocker is **CLEARED (#943)** — the `!platform` group moved onto `PlatformCommandsMixin` (`cogs/diagnostic/platform_group.py`), cog now 260 LOC, so the next `!platform` subcommand has room. **Security service tiers 1+2 is still IN FLIGHT** (PR #929, `needs-hermes-review` carve-out — raid detection + account-age filter, Q-0111). **BUG-0009 slices 1/2/2b all shipped** (#924 MK-related · #926 Geraldo per-level + game-mode groupings); the one remaining family — newest-towers ordering — is **data-gated** (`towers.json` has no release-order field). The rest of P1 (absence-guard Layer B · live-quality battery) is creds/review-blocked. *The live next-step is THIS sentence — **not** any other "next ▶ =" lower in this callout or in the dated `Last updated:` stamps further down (those are historical reconciliation snapshots: e.g. a stamp still reads "next ▶ = mining Forge", but Forge shipped #905). Trust this line + the Recently-shipped list, never a stamp.*

> **▶ NIGHT QUEUE (2026-06-16, owner directive — scheduled dispatch fires read THIS first): advance the [night queue](planning/night-queue-2026-06-16.md).** It makes the otherwise-`plan-first` "AI §7 next workflow family" lane **concrete and buildable now**: an ordered set of independent, **read-only deterministic BTD6 floor builders** (the proven #946/#950/#955/#962/#975/#1000/#1008/#1009/#1010 lane — §7.5 comparison + §7.6 roster), each **data-complete today** (reads a field already in a committed `disbot/data/btd6/*.json`), each ships under **Q-0048** (no prod-check, auto-deploys), each closes the **BUG-0009** "grounded values / wrong assembly" class (the standing P1 priority). **An empty scheduled fire builds the topmost `TODO` slice** (slot 1 hero cost-comparison shipped **#1000**; slot 2 power cost comparison shipped **#1008**; slot 3 relic category/effect roster shipped **#1009**; slot 5 hero ability roster shipped **#1010**; **slot 4 reframed → bloon *modifier explainer* shipped #1011** (camo/fortified/regrow are universal modifiers, not per-type properties — option (c) of the slot-4 reframe); both buffer slices shipped **#1011** — MK category roster + the Geraldo starting-kit angle). **The night queue is now FULLY consumed** — every ready slot, the slot-4 reframe, and both buffer slices have shipped. **But the proven, ungated BTD6 deterministic-floor lane still has thinning backlog** beyond the curated queue: **#1012 (2026-06-17)** shipped three more gaps in the same `btd6_context_service` floor — boss roster + per-difficulty map filter (`deterministic_roster_reply`) + boss damage-immunity (`deterministic_boss_immunity_reply`). Remaining ungated floor candidates are getting scarce (most rosters now covered: towers/heroes/paragons/maps/bosses/MK/relics/bloons/hero-abilities + cost comparisons + immunity); a future empty fire can add a *genuinely-asked* uncovered shape (e.g. boss tier-HP comparison, paragon-ability lookup) **or** take a fresh **plan-first lane** (image-mod #941 in-flight · security tiers #929 — both owner/Hermes-review-gated). Do NOT invent low-value floor builders to fill the queue (forced filler ≠ work). A `/bugreport` or `continue` handoff still jumps this queue (bugs-first). Seam + per-slice turn-key recipes are in the queue doc.

> **▶ Next action — one live queue:** **TWELFTH Q-0107 PASS DONE (2026-06-18, band-#1050, issue #1051 — [pass record + next-band queue](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-06-18-band1050.md)).** The next band is deep but **tooling/workflow-weighted** (the honest read — band-#1050 §3): the bot-product sectors (S1/S2) are correctly gated/exhausted (BTD6 floors complete · fishing owner-design-gated Q-0175 · **image-mod #941 + security tiers #929 BOTH SHIPPED 2026-06-18** — the two `needs-hermes-review` carve-outs finally merged, correcting the prior passes' stale "in-flight, awaiting merge" prose below · dashboard write owner-paced), so the ungated buildable depth lives in S3/S4/S5. **▶ consistency-linter Lane A1 SHIPPED (#1054, 2026-06-18) — the `views/selectors/` API-ripple set is windowed:** the 5 primitives (role/channel/multi/multi_role/subsystem) became windowed `attach_*` helpers over `attach_windowed_select`, all 8 consumers updated, and the upstream truncation source (`build_select_options` `limit=None`) root-fixed; `select_option_truncation` warn-only **15 → 7**. **▶ consistency-linter Lane A2 SHIPPED (#1056, 2026-06-19) — the 7 per-panel embedded selects are windowed:** `access/explorer` · `channels/create_panel` + `channels/move_panel` (retired the bespoke `_CategorySelect` classes) · `diagnostic/automation_panel` (+ a new `SelectWindow.detach()` for clean re-render) · `settings/subsystem_view` (×2; edit dispatcher extracted to module-level `dispatch_edit_setting`) · `setup/sections/channels` all moved onto `attach_windowed_select`; `select_option_truncation` warn-only **7 → 0** — the rule now runs clean on the whole `views/` tree. **▶ consistency-linter rule-3 reconcile SHIPPED (#1057, 2026-06-19):** the `panel_base_class` rule flagged 26 but the arch `baseview_inheritance` ratchet already path-exempts `views/ai/`+`views/games/` (documented lifecycle) and pins the rest to an 8-entry conformance frozenset — so the rule was re-flagging already-decided arch exemptions (Q-0120). Reconciled (mirrored the path exemptions + allowlisted the 8 documented per-view exceptions); `panel_base_class` warn-only **26 → 0** (NOT migrated — the obvious targets are documented "migrate only with a concrete gain" exceptions). **▶ consistency-linter rule-1 (`edit_in_place`) TRIAGED (#1058, 2026-06-19):** the untriaged 45 candidates were split — a checker improvement (the house `self._rerender()` helper idiom is now recognized as editing-in-place, Q-0120), one real fix (`DiagnosticsPanel.refresh_btn` now re-renders the stale "Members Cached" field), and 26 genuinely-correct new-message callbacks allowlisted with reasons (sub-flow pickers · shared multiplayer lobby/match messages · the persistent launcher's ephemeral sub-flows · terminal/advisory toasts). `edit_in_place` **45 → 17** — the 17 remaining are *exactly* the `views/ai/` family, the owner's documented "AI panels stack ephemerals" inconsistency tracked by [`ideas/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-2026-06-11.md`](ideas/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-2026-06-11.md) (NOT allowlisted: that is the real bug the rule exists to catch; rule 1 stays warn-only until that redesign ships). **▶ consistency-linter rule-2 (`back_button`) TRIAGED to 0 (#1059, 2026-06-19):** traced each of the 7 flagged `HubView`s to its construction site — all 7 are top-of-stack ROOT panels opened directly by a cog command (no parent to return to: access-explorer · the channels-stack root · cleanup · `!platform automation` · diagnostics hub · deathmatch · xp hub), the known FP class. Allowlisted all 7 with per-class reasons; `back_button` **7 → 0**. **▶ consistency-linter graduation tracker SHIPPED (#1062, 2026-06-19)** — executed the #1060 session idea + the documented "graduation prep" step: each `Rule` in `scripts/check_consistency.py` now carries a `severity` (graduating = flip `"warning"`→`"error"`, enforced by `--mode strict` since `run_checks` stamps each finding with its rule's severity) + a `graduation_blocker`; `check_consistency.py --graduation` reports per-rule **ELIGIBLE / NOT READY / BLOCKED (by what) / GRADUATED**. Live state it reports: `back_button` / `panel_base_class` / `select_option_truncation` = **ELIGIBLE** (0 findings); `edit_in_place` = **BLOCKED** on the AI-nav plan (#1060). **▶ consistency-linter graduation SHIPPED (#1094, 2026-06-19):** the 3 ELIGIBLE rules (`back_button` / `panel_base_class` / `select_option_truncation`) ran clean across #1056→#1062, so their `Rule.severity` flipped `"warning"`→`"error"` and `python3.10 scripts/check_consistency.py --mode strict` is **wired into `code-quality.yml`** (deps block) + the `check_quality.py` local mirror — a finding from any of the three now **fails CI**; `--graduation` reads GRADUATED for each. `edit_in_place` stays warn-only (BLOCKED on the AI-nav redesign). **▶ Next ungated startable = ONE of** (consistency-linter lane, [plan](planning/repo-consistency-linter-plan-2026-06-17.md)): **(a)** execute the AI-nav plan **PR 1** ([plan](planning/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-plan-2026-06-19.md)) to start clearing rule 1's 17 `views/ai/` findings — needs a runtime/Q-0086 live-walk session, `needs-hermes-review` (graduating `edit_in_place` follows once it reaches 0); **(b)** add rule 5+ only as a fresh mechanical-consistency shape surfaces (a candidate: extend rule 4 to `disbot/cogs/`); or a fresh lane: procedures→skills Batch 1 ([plan](planning/procedures-to-skills-conversion-plan-2026-06-17.md)), owner-review-inbox Phase 1 ([plan](planning/owner-review-inbox-plan-2026-06-17.md)), or the small stdlib guards (`check_plan_backlog.py`, `check_ledger_hygiene.py`, …). **No PLAN-BACKLOG-THIN flag** — ~18–22 ready slices. The owner-side lever to rebalance toward bot features (now that #941/#929 have shipped): decide a Q-0175 fishing open question or greenlight a dashboard write surface. *(Historical band context follows — trust THIS sentence + the Recently-shipped list, never a lower "next ▶".)* **THE IDEA→PLAN GATE IS NOW OPEN (Q-0172, 2026-06-17) — this fixes the "running out of plans" shortage:** when the buildable queue is thin, any agent may promote a `docs/ideas/` idea into a `docs/planning/` plan and **build it without owner approval**, flagged on the run-report `⚑ Self-initiated:` line (the dashboard badges it for review). **Fishing v1 is BUILT + RECONCILED to the owner's #1036 design (MERGED #1033 → #1039 → #1041) — its next slices are owner-design-gated:** the authoritative design is the owner's brain-dump [`planning/fishing-open-world-expansion-plan-2026-06-18.md`](planning/fishing-open-world-expansion-plan-2026-06-18.md) (Q-0175) — 21 size-ranked fish · 7 levels × 3 (level-gated catch) · leveling reuses `game_xp` · unified character with swappable gear-type loadouts · boat/open-world in Phase 2+. The interim v1 (#1033: 14 fish / rarity tiers / coins) was **reconciled to the spec in #1039 + #1041** (21-fish JSON, level/size-band deterministic roll, no-coins collection log; `economy_service` dropped from the path; migration 076 drops the value cols). `!fish` · `!fishlog` · `!fishtop` ship. **The remaining Phase-1 fishing slices are owner-design-gated** — the unified loadout presets, fish value/cook/sell, and the catch minigame are all explicitly-deferred open questions per Q-0175 (do NOT decide unprompted); the open-world Explore hub fishing would surface in is itself a Phase-2-ish design effort (no clean hub exists yet). So fishing is **paused on owner input**, not a current empty-fire lane. **▶ Next ungated startable (THIS run picked it) = the owner-directed repo-consistency-linter (Q-0170)** — `scripts/check_consistency.py`, "CI but for UX/interaction inconsistencies", built one rule per PR ([plan](planning/repo-consistency-linter-plan-2026-06-17.md)). **PR 1 (harness + rule 1 edit-in-place) shipped #1042; PR 2 + 3 (rule 2 back-button presence + rule 3 panel base-class) shipped #1043; PR 4 (rule 4 select-option truncation) shipped #1044** — first-run counts back_button=7 (mostly top-of-stack hub openers, the known external-attach FP), panel_base_class=30 (the AI picker / settings-select / btd6-admin direct-`discord.ui.View` extenders), **select_option_truncation=53** (the #1040 silent-drop class is *widespread*: shared `selectors/`, roles/channels panels, mining market, btd6 browsers, settings enum-editor all front-`[:25]`-truncate select options; a small subclass are genuine top-N *display* truncations to allowlist), all warn-only. **The plan's rule backlog (1–4) is now built, and the select-truncation triage is UNDERWAY (PR #1047, 2026-06-18).** #1047 built the **shared `views/paginated_select.py` `PaginatedSelectView` primitive** (a reusable windowed select + Prev/Next nav, generalising the two bespoke implementations `_CogPickView` + `EntityPickerView`), dogfooded it on cog-routing, migrated the **role-delete picker** onto it (real >25-roles bug fixed; retired the direct-`discord.ui.View` `_DeleteRoleView`, ratcheting `panel_base_class` 30→29), and **triaged the 53 `select_option_truncation` candidates → 31 genuine** (allowlisted 22 false-positives — embed/text top-N displays + bounded fixed-catalog selects — with per-callback reasons in `consistency_exceptions.yml`). It also **fixed a latent linter bug**: `rule_select_option_truncation` now computes the enclosing class/method qualname (was `''`), so the documented `::Class.method` allowlist scoping actually works. **The standalone-ephemeral pickers shipped #1048 (2026-06-18):** the three cleanly-standalone single-select ephemeral pickers moved onto `PaginatedSelectView` — `settings/edit_enum` (`EnumSettingSelectView`/`_EnumSelect` → `build_enum_select_view`), `roles/time_roles_panel` (`_TimeRemoveView`), `roles/xp_roles_panel` (`_XpRemoveView`); each retired **both** its `select_option_truncation` (31→28) and `panel_base_class` (29→26) finding and ratcheted `baseview_inheritance` arch debt 12→9. **▶ The embedded-windowing design step is now BUILT (#1050, 2026-06-18)** — `views/paginated_select.py` exposes `attach_windowed_select(view, options, on_select, …)` + the shared `SelectWindow` controller (windowed `Select` + ◀/▶ nav as a *band* of items inside any host view, removing only its own items on a page flip). #1050 triaged the 28 candidates → **15** (dogfooded the helper on `access_map`; allowlisted 12 fixed-catalog btd6/mining selects). **▶ Next consistency-linter slice = migrate the 15 remaining genuinely-dynamic embedded selects onto `attach_windowed_select`** — the **shared `views/selectors/` primitives** (`role`/`channel`/`multi`/`multi_role`/`subsystem`: this is the **API-ripple set** — they are `discord.ui.Select` subclasses added via `view.add_item(...)`, so windowing them means converting each to an `attach_*` helper + updating its ~8 consumers (channels delete/visibility/create/restrict/move panels, roles xp/time/exemptions panels); do this as one focused PR), then the **per-panel** ones with their own row budgets (`channels/move_panel`·`visibility_panel`·`create_panel`, `settings/subsystem_view` edit/reset selects, `setup/sections/channels`, `access/explorer`, `diagnostic/automation_panel`). Each per-panel migration is a small swap now the helper exists (pass `select_row`/`nav_row` to fit the host's 5-row budget — see `access_map._attach_feature_detail_select` for the pattern). The other graduation work stands: (b) once a rule runs quiet on a clean tree across a few sessions, flip it to error + wire it into `code-quality.yml`; (c) add rule 5+ only as a fresh mechanical-consistency shape surfaces (forced filler ≠ work); a possible follow-up is extending rule 4 to `disbot/cogs/`. An empty fire with no triage appetite should take a fresh PLAN-FIRST lane instead. (Mining is built/owner-gated; exploration's `!explore` shipped #606 — neither is the shortage.) Historical queue follows: the **[band-#1020 decade queue](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-06-17-band1020.md)** §4 — the eleventh Q-0107 pass (2026-06-17, issue #1021; cadence every 30th PR per Q-0134). **▶ moderation-DM config SHIPPED (#1023, 2026-06-17)** — per-action moderation DMs on the *existing* `moderation_service` seam (`dm_actions` allow-list gating the `dm_on_action` master switch, off by default, default = all four notify-eligible actions so behaviour is unchanged; Q-0147). **▶ Next ungated startable = pick a fresh PLAN-FIRST lane** (image-mod #941 + security tiers #929 stay `needs-hermes-review`; the BTD6 deterministic-floor lane is thin/complete; the dashboard write/manifest lanes are owner-paced). **▶ paragon-ability + boss tier-HP floors SHIPPED (#1024, 2026-06-17)** — the two BTD6 deterministic-floor shapes current-state previously named as still-valid empty-fire candidates (`deterministic_paragon_ability_roster_reply` off the curated `paragon_abilities.json` + `deterministic_boss_hp_comparison_reply` off `bosses[].tiers`/`.elite_tiers`, both on the `_BTD6_LIST_BUILDERS` seam, BUG-0009 class). **The proven ungated BTD6 floor lane is now essentially exhausted** — rosters/comparisons/immunity/abilities for towers/heroes/paragons/bosses/MK/relics/bloons are all covered; a further empty fire should prefer a fresh PLAN-FIRST lane over inventing a low-value floor (forced filler ≠ work). The dashboard **manifest-spine PR4** (panel-layout editor) is owner-paced (control-API write side); the AI deterministic-floor family is COMPLETE (night queue fully consumed, #1008–#1012); image-mod #941 + security tiers #929 are open `needs-hermes-review` carve-outs awaiting a human merge. **▶ dashboard.json freshness reporter SHIPPED (#1025, 2026-06-17)** — the #1020 finding/idea: a warn-only structural-drift reporter (`check_dashboard_data.py --drift`, compares cog/command/env/setting/catalogue/synonym *identifier sets* only, never the volatile churn) + regenerated the stale committed `dashboard.json` (it was missing env-vars `HEALTH_HOST`/`RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` and setting `moderation_dm_actions`) + routed the cadence-regen to the docs-reconciliation routine. **▶ generated-artifact freshness umbrella SHIPPED (PR #1027, 2026-06-17)** — generalized #1025 into `scripts/check_generated_artifacts_fresh.py`, a registry-driven warn-only umbrella over all three committed-generated families (dashboard.json → delegates to `check_dashboard_data --drift`; `env-vars.md` → env-var name set; `docs/agent/generated/*.context.md` → per-pack line set, date line dropped), so no future generated file silently rots; Q-0105 dev tooling (read-only/stdlib/disposable), **not hard-CI-wired** (ask-first; `--strict` is for the reconciliation cadence pass). **▶ Next ungated startable still = a fresh PLAN-FIRST lane** (the AI §7 next workflow family post deterministic-floors, or the Hermes bug-triage `gh issue create` write Q-0121 — design write-scope first); the BTD6 floor lane is exhausted, dashboard write/manifest is owner-paced, image-mod #941 + security #929 stay `needs-hermes-review`. *(The historical context that follows is a prior-band snapshot — trust this line + the Recently-shipped list.)* The band-#930 queue is fully executed (AI §7.5/§7.6 floors #946/#950/#955/#962/#975 · myprofile #938/#940 · security tiers #929 · diagnostics #937 · architecture-atlas Q-0151 #957/#958/#960/#964) and the **developer-dashboard / control-API initiative is the active thread** (#974/#990/#993/#995, Q-0155–Q-0160); its read-only surfaces all shipped, the next slices are owner/creds-gated (live editor · auth · Railway-API). The band-#900 queue is nearly fully executed (Forge #905 · P1-3 #917/#918 · log-triage #906 · Home/respec/titles #910/#912 · BUG-0009 #924/#926 · welcome #920); security tiers 1+2 is in flight (#929). **The mining structures / skill-tree lane is now COMPLETE** — every ▶ startable slice shipped (D #891 · A #897 · B/Forge #905 · C/Home #910 · E respec-polish + F titles #912); the only remaining items are owner-gated (Vault-cap *hard* enforcement · ⛔ V-16 phase 2 real sprites). **The Railway log-triage skill shipped (#906) and P1-3 invariants are now SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE (#917, 2026-06-15).** The 2026-06-15 P1-3 pass reviewed all four tracks, found + closed the **two** genuine buildable-now gaps with CI-runnable AST invariants — **settings** declared→runtime-consumer parity (`test_settings_declared_vs_consumed_parity.py`, 0 dead of 63 declared settings; the explicitly-named missing invariant from the settings map §Required #3) and **games** wager write-boundary completeness (`test_two_sided_economy_calls_are_accounted_for` — the hardcoded `_WAGER_FILES` fence now also fails on a *new* two-party mint path). **AI** is substantially-covered by the 34/34 catalogue/eval ratchet (closed, no new invariant); **BTD6** source-provenance is invariant-covered and uniform per-derived-value attribution is a documented design-for-review residual (brittle as an AST guard). Full record: [the P1-3 disposition](planning/production-readiness/p1-3-contract-invariants-disposition-2026-06-15.md). **The safety quick-win shipped (welcome phase 2 PIL cards, #920, 2026-06-15):** a `welcome_card_enabled` toggle (off by default) attaches a rendered PIL greeting card to the join embed; the `render_welcome_card` prototype graduated to `utils/welcome_render.py` (the UX-lab gallery now re-exports the production renderer — one source of truth); degrades cleanly to embed-only when Pillow is unavailable. **BUG-0009 slice 1 shipped (#924, 2026-06-15): the "MK related to <tower>" family** — the model no longer assembles that list (it grabbed the whole Support *category* and mislabeled it farm-related); `btd6_data_service.monkey_knowledge_referencing` derives the MK↔tower relation deterministically (description names the tower's canonical/upgrade-path name → strong; alias → weak, suppressed when another tower is strongly referenced or the MK is a Powers/Heroes-tab point), served as a **pre-emptive floor** on the BTD6 path (this class *passes* the value-only faithfulness guard, so the post-hoc roster floor never caught it). **BUG-0009 slices 2 + 2b shipped (#926, 2026-06-15): the "Geraldo items per level" + "game mode groupings" families** — the model no longer assembles either grouping. Geraldo: `btd6_data_service.geraldo_items_by_unlock_level` owns the level→items map, `deterministic_geraldo_per_level_reply` formats the full grouping / a single level's unlocks / an honest "nothing unlocks at level N".

## Stability baseline

Operational stability **accepted after #535** (live cog walk: server-management,
economy, moderation, games, hub navigation). **Do not run a broad re-audit unless
a regression is reported** — this is an *accepted baseline*, not a fresh re-test.
Env-gated features (AI / scheduler / YouTube / Paragon / webhook) run **degraded
in the sandbox**, not broken. Known UX follow-ups remain (below).

## In flight (verify against live GitHub)

**Do not trust a hard-coded PR count here — it goes stale on every push.** Get the
real list at session start from live GitHub (`list_pull_requests`, state=open);
this snapshot deliberately names no open PRs. For an initiative's shipped/queued
status read its tracker (e.g. the server-management tracker), not this section.
Source code and merged PRs win over anything written here.

## Recently shipped (newest first)

> Convention: **merged PRs only** (with #numbers). In-flight work is *not* listed here —
> get it from live GitHub. The newest merge a session sees may not be added yet; that
> lag is expected (the next session reconciles). A merged PR tagged "pending" is the bug.

- **#1094 (2026-06-19, consistency-linter graduation — 3 rules flipped to error, Q-0170)** — the
  `back_button` / `panel_base_class` / `select_option_truncation` rules ran clean across #1056→#1062,
  so each `Rule.severity` flipped `"warning"`→`"error"` and `python3.10 scripts/check_consistency.py
  --mode strict` is now wired into `code-quality.yml` (deps block) + the `check_quality.py` local
  mirror — a finding from any of the three now **fails CI**. `edit_in_place` stays warn-only (BLOCKED
  on the AI-nav redesign, [plan](planning/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-plan-2026-06-19.md)).
- **#1081 · #1083 · #1084 · #1087 · #1092 (2026-06-19, ultracode-fleet wave A — helper extraction)** —
  the executed half of the [ultracode-fleet plan](planning/ultracode-fleet-plan-2026-06-19.md): paired
  helper-extraction / refactor slices — moderation helpers (#1081), governance exceptions (#1083),
  BaseView conformance (#1084), `utils/db` wrappers (#1087), blackjack state (#1092). (Wave B — the
  guard/tooling slices #1082/#1085/#1086/#1088–#1091/#1093 — is the in-flight open set; verify on live GitHub.)
- **#1064 · #1079 (2026-06-19, repo-governance + supply-chain baseline + ultracode-fleet plan)** —
  #1064 added the open-source governance / supply-chain baseline (CodeQL workflow, `dependabot.yml`,
  issue/PR templates, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CITATION.cff, dashboard-CI) + the
  [repo-structure-improvement plan](planning/repo-structure-improvement-plan-2026-06-19.md); #1079
  added the ultracode-fleet plan that spawned waves A/B.
- **#1065–#1073 · #1075–#1078 (2026-06-19, dependabot dependency-bump band)** — the dependency bumps
  the new `dependabot.yml` (#1064) immediately raised: GitHub Actions majors (cache-5, codeql-action-4,
  github-script-9, checkout-7, setup-python-6) + pip deps (anthropic, uvicorn, httpx, fastapi, jinja2 —
  root + dashboard `requirements`). (#1074, the python-minor-patch dev group, is still open — verify on live GitHub.)
- **#1061 (2026-06-19, dashboard generated-data refresh)** — `Merge pull request #1061 from
  menno420/bot/dashboard-refresh` — the per-source-merge `dashboard-data-refresh` workflow (Q-0167)
  regenerated the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json` from live source.
- **#1060 (2026-06-19, consistency-linter — AI-nav idea → executable plan, Q-0172 self-initiated)** —
  promoted [`ideas/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-2026-06-11.md`](ideas/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-2026-06-11.md)
  into [`planning/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-plan-2026-06-19.md`](planning/ai-panel-inplace-navigation-plan-2026-06-19.md)
  (the only blocker for graduating consistency rule 1 `edit_in_place`); updated the ideas-README + roadmap.
- **#1055 (2026-06-18, dashboard generated-data refresh)** — `Merge pull request #1055 from
  menno420/bot/dashboard-refresh` — the per-source-merge `dashboard-data-refresh` workflow regen.
- **#1053 (2026-06-18, twelfth Q-0107 reconciliation pass — band-#1050)** — the docs-only
  reconciliation pass ([record](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-06-18-band1050.md)): reconciled the
  ledger (added #1022/#1029, trimmed to the 20 newest → archive), planned the next band, reset the
  `Last reconciliation pass` marker to #1050.
- **#1052 (2026-06-18, dashboard generated-data refresh)** — `Merge pull request #1052 from
  menno420/bot/dashboard-refresh` — the per-source-merge `dashboard-data-refresh` workflow (Q-0167)
  regenerated the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json` from live source.
- **#1050 (2026-06-18, consistency-linter — embedded windowed-select helper + bounded-catalog triage)** —
  the design step the #1048 handoff named: refactored `views/paginated_select.py` to share **one**
  windowing core — a `SelectWindow` controller that manages a *band* of items (a windowed `Select` +
  ◀/▶ nav) inside **any host view**, removing only its own items on a page flip so it composes with a
  multi-control panel; `PaginatedSelectView` is now a thin wrapper over it (constructor unchanged) and a
  new `attach_windowed_select(view, options, on_select, …)` exposes the embedded path. **Triaged the 28
  `select_option_truncation` candidates → 15**: dogfooded the helper on `access_map`'s feature
  drill-down (`_FeatureDetailSelect` → `_attach_feature_detail_select`, a genuinely-dynamic select that
  could exceed 25), and **allowlisted 12** backed by a fixed in-repo catalog / game-data roster (btd6
  tower roster + live-events feed; the curated mining taxonomy market/recipe/workshop/gear selects) —
  same standard as the existing btd6-catalog allowlist entries (not the #1040 bug). The **15 remaining**
  are all genuinely guild-scaled embedded selects — the shared `views/selectors/` primitives
  (role/channel/multi/multi_role/subsystem; the API-ripple set) + the channels move/visibility/create
  panels, `settings/subsystem_view` edit/reset selects, `setup/sections/channels`, `access/explorer`,
  and `diagnostic/automation_panel` — see the ▶ Next-action handoff.
- **#1049 (2026-06-18, dashboard refresh)** — `Merge pull request #1049 from
  menno420/bot/dashboard-refresh` (newest-merge lag catch-up; recorded on sight per Q-0166).
- **#1048 (2026-06-18, consistency-linter — standalone select pickers → `PaginatedSelectView`)** —
  migrated the three cleanly-standalone single-select ephemeral pickers onto the shared
  `views/paginated_select.py` primitive: `settings/edit_enum` (`EnumSettingSelectView`/`_EnumSelect`
  → the `build_enum_select_view` factory), `roles/time_roles_panel` (`_TimeRemoveView`), and
  `roles/xp_roles_panel` (`_XpRemoveView`). Each retired **both** its `select_option_truncation`
  (31→28) and `panel_base_class` (29→26) consistency finding and fixed the latent #1040 >25-option
  silent-drop; the `baseview_inheritance` arch debt ratcheted 12→9. The remaining
  `select_option_truncation` candidates are all embedded in multi-control views (need an
  embedded-windowing design step — see the ▶ Next-action handoff).
- **#1046 (2026-06-18, dashboard generated-data refresh)** — `chore(dashboard): refresh generated
  data` — regenerated the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json` from live source (the cadence-regen
  routed to the docs-reconciliation routine in #1025).
- **#1045 (2026-06-18, dashboard-data-refresh CI fix)** — `fix(ci): make dashboard-data-refresh
  actually work` — corrected the dashboard-data-refresh workflow to use the PR-flow auto-merge path so
  the generated-data refresh lands instead of stalling.
- **#1042 (2026-06-18, repo-consistency-linter PR 1 — Q-0170)** — the owner-directed "CI but for
  UX/interaction inconsistencies" tool, `scripts/check_consistency.py` (stdlib AST over `disbot/views/`,
  `check_architecture`-style `Rule` registry + an `architecture_rules/consistency_exceptions.yml`
  allowlist, warn-only/disposable per Q-0105). PR 1 = the harness + **rule 1 (edit-in-place)**: a panel
  button/select callback that delivers its result as a standalone ephemeral instead of editing the panel
  in place (45 first-run candidates, allowlist empty). Built one rule per PR; rules 2+3 followed (#1043).
- **#1041 (2026-06-18, fishing reconciliation Codex follow-ups)** — addressed the Codex review on the
  fishing-v1→#1036-spec reconciliation: migration hygiene (the value-column drop), the legacy-count
  guard (a player who fished under the superseded interim catalog can have rows the current 21-fish
  catalog doesn't, so `!fishlog`/`!fishtop` count only current-catalog species), and a dependency tidy.
- **#1040 (2026-06-18, setup cog-routing picker pagination)** — the cog-routing select hard-capped at
  `visible[:25]`; the routable-subsystem registry has grown past 25 (35), so the cap silently dropped
  every cog past the 25th (moderation, role, settings, …) — an operator literally could not route them.
  `_operator_visible_cogs()` now returns the full sorted list and a new `_CogPickView(BaseView)` pages
  it into ≤25-option windows with ◀ Prev / Next ▶ nav. Bug already on `main`; a registry-drift class.
- **#1039 (2026-06-18, fishing v1 reconciled to the owner's #1036 design — Q-0175)** — the interim
  fishing v1 (#1033: 14 fish, 5 rarity tiers, coins per catch) was built before the owner's #1036 spec
  landed and contradicted it. Reconciled the shipped code to the spec: the 21-size-ranked-fish
  `data/fishing/fish.json`, the level/size-band deterministic-roll catch (7 levels × 3), a no-coins
  collection log (`economy_service` dropped from the fishing path; migration 076 drops the value cols).
- **#1038 (2026-06-18, BTD6 "which MK affects <tower>" — owner live-test)** — the model no longer
  assembles the class-wide MK list itself; `btd6_data_service`/`btd6_context_service` derive and list the
  class-wide Monkey Knowledge for a tower deterministically, and a sniper routing miss (the question
  not reaching the BTD6 path) was fixed in `ai_task_router`.
- **#1037 (2026-06-18, BTD6 round_cash identity ABR fix — Codex P2 on #1035)** — gated the inclusive
  range `identity` sentence to emit only when the cumulative subtraction reconciles with `range_cash`;
  it was contradicting `range_cash` for ABR ranges spanning the unplayed rounds 1-2 (the cumulative
  totals start at round 3). Self-validating, so the existing `cumulative_note` covers the excluded case.
- **Older merges (#1036 … #535) → [`current-state-archive.md`](current-state-archive.md).** Recently-shipped keeps the ~20 newest; older entries are trimmed to the archive (newest-first), which `scripts/check_docs.py` soft-ratchets at 20 and `check_current_state_ledger.py` treats as present. *(The thirteenth Q-0107 pass — band-#1080, 2026-06-19 — added the repo-governance/supply-chain + ultracode-fleet-A + dependabot band (#1064–#1094) and trimmed the live ledger back to the 20 newest, moving #1036 … #1028 to the archive.)*

## Next candidates

- **Cross-area sequencing + the plan index now live in [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md)**
  (by area, with Now / Next / Later / Someday horizons + gates — where to find which plan
  for which part of the code). The picks below are the current top of that list.
- Server-management is **structurally complete** *(bullet corrected 2026-06-10 — it
  still queued PR14 long after the hub merged)*: **PR10 complete** (six slices,
  ADR-008), **PR11** (#570; governance section **deferred** — revisit only with a
  scope decision), **PR12** (2026-06-07), **PR13's deterministic slice** (2026-06-08,
  incl. the migration-059 staging fix), and **PR14 — the unified Server Management
  Hub — shipped 2026-06-08 via #584**. The only remainder is the **gated PR13 AI
  generation layer**. The `docs/planning/server-management-status-2026-06-05.md`
  tracker (re-badged `historical` 2026-06-13 — initiative complete) is the historical
  record; the gated PR13 AI tail lives in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) → Later. Don't duplicate it here.
- Health/diagnostics maintainer live-tests (production AI tool + grouped findings):
  see `docs/subsystems/health-diagnostics.md`.
- **Docs consolidation (Q-0010) — executed 2026-06-08.** Top-level `docs/` is now **16**
  (the 13 binding contracts + `current-state` + `roadmap` + `context-map-tooling`); plans /
  audits / inventories / historical snapshots moved into clustered subdirs behind their
  folios, and `_TOP_LEVEL_DOCS_BUDGET` lowered 41 → 16. Paired with the idea-backlog
  lifecycle + grooming secondary task (Q-0015, `docs/ideas/README.md`) and the binding-doc
  section-ownership convention (`docs/owner/ai-project-workflow.md` §9). The original handoff
  was [`planning/docs-restructure-brief-2026-06-08.md`](planning/docs-restructure-brief-2026-06-08.md).

## Gates / blocked work

- **Autonomous loop — see the canonical [Control-plane state table](operations/autonomous-routines.md)
  § "Control-plane state".** That table is the single source of truth for the loop's state (does it
  self-fire · `ROUTINE_PAT` · Railway env · dispatch-prompt version · model pins); **do not restate
  its verdict here.** This bullet is a pure pointer on purpose — a control-plane verdict copied into
  this file drifted from the canonical table twice (the band-#870 and band-#930 passes each had to
  re-sync it by hand), so the copy is deliberately gone (idea
  `control-plane-single-source-pointer-2026-06-15`). The live read no in-repo checker can see is the
  `reconcile` trigger-issue author (`menno420` = PAT set & loop self-fires; `github-actions[bot]` =
  PAT unset); `check_loop_health.py` (Q-0135) probes live GitHub for the same truth.
- **Open bugs (bug book):** **BUG-0009** (AI list-answer mislabeling — needs the AI orchestration §7
  deterministic list-builders, plan-level) and **BUG-0011** (Hermes gateway restart crash-loop — needs
  a clean VPS foreground repro) stay OPEN — [`health/bug-book.md`](health/bug-book.md).
- **Open decisions:** **Q-0096** remainder (Context7 adopted #737; **Postgres-MCP + `pyright-lsp`**
  undecided) · **Q-0120/Q-0121** (the workflow pass's proposals — candidate-rule promotion · Hermes
  bug-triage `gh issue create` write). *(**Q-0119 answered 2026-06-13** → governance role pointers
  get their own reserved-namespace `governance` schema home (option a); P0-3 family 3 is unblocked
  for a future arc PR — router §Q-0119 + the [convergence plan §5](planning/settings-pointer-lane-convergence-plan-2026-06-13.md).)*
- **AI / BTD6 feature expansion — re-postured 2026-06-09 (Q-0048):** AI tools that are
  **read-only AND deterministic** (no writes, no external calls, audience-tiered) carry a
  **standing lift** and may ship without a per-case ask. Anything that **writes, costs
  money, calls external services, or adds UI** still needs the per-exposure lift, and broad
  expansion stays gated on *all* of: bot-wide stability **+** provider/provenance checks
  **+** caching / source-health clarity **+** AI behavior/config correctness.
- **BTD6 data extraction** — ADR-006 provenance schema **now implemented**
  (`docs/btd6/btd6-provenance-schema.md`); extraction may resume against the ordered
  backlog in `docs/btd6/btd6-gamedata-decode-status.md`. The broader AI/BTD6
  feature-expansion gate (stability + provider/provenance + caching + AI config) still
  applies.
- `_derive_scope` → `PLATFORM_OWNER` (decision D1) — **RESOLVED** in #541; owner-only
  AI tools are now reachable.

## Known UX follow-ups (not stability bugs)

- Server-management member/role UX follow-ups: see
  `docs/subsystems/server-management.md`.
- Dense DiagnosticCog platform-subview pagination idea: see
  `docs/subsystems/health-diagnostics.md`.

## Near-term technical debt (decided, not yet implemented)

*(The Q-0025 `new_subsystem.py` scaffold that used to sit here is reconciled: built
and used to register Community Spotlight in **#626** (execution-plan Lane 1,
2026-06-09 — verify merged on live GitHub).)*

*(The Q-0026 `cog_name_to_subsystem` fix that used to sit here is reconciled: merged
in **#588**, listed under Recently shipped.)*

## Off-limits / do-not-propose

- No Redis / external state store (**ADR-001**).
- Game state is **not** restart-safe by design (**ADR-002**) — accepted, not a bug.
- Do not re-litigate the rejection ledger in
  `docs/planning/superbot-ideas-lab-2026-06-05.md` §6.
- Do not restate "bot fully tested & working" as *newly* verified without an actual
  boot + live walk — cite the #535 baseline instead.

## Where to read next

The **canonical read path + "what lives where"** lives in
**`docs/AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`** ("Reading order by task" + the document-classification
lists). This file is *step 3* of that path: read it for **what is true right now**, then
follow the orientation route for your task. The read-path table is **not** duplicated
here — one canonical home (`AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`).

**One-fact-one-home rule:** if a fact belongs in one of those homes, **link** to it —
do not restate it here. Restatement across files is where drift breeds. In particular,
**don't summarize plans'/trackers' PR numbers or status here** — link to the folio or
tracker, which is authoritative for its own area.
