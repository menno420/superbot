Also decided: BTD6 data-refresh automation = **manual-dispatch workflow** (Q-0049 — **built same day in #633**, execution-plan Lane 5: `workflow_dispatch`-only, opens a reviewable PR, never pushes to main); mining descent lights **permanent, owner-confirmed** (Q-0050); the five product-vision questions (Q-0038–Q-0042) got their **draft-answer session** (Q-0051) **and the maintainer marked all five up same day (Lane 6, PR #631, structured choices)**: Q-0038 server-scoped clans, Q-0039 cosmetic-only donations (no bot-side billing), Q-0041 YouTube-first/dual-opt-in/voice-deferred, Q-0042 staged-Someday website — all approved as drafted; **Q-0040 adjusted: the AI dungeon master picks quests/rewards/difficulty from bounded, hard-capped menus** (not pure narration, not free-form authority). Posture decisions only — every lane still needs its own plan/promotion + the AI per-exposure lift; conclusions routed to the four roadmap drafts + router §21.

## Stability baseline

Operational stability **accepted after #535** (live cog walk: server-management,
economy, moderation, games, hub navigation). **Do not run a broad re-audit unless
a regression is reported** — this is an *accepted baseline*, not a fresh re-test.
Env-gated features (AI / scheduler / YouTube / Paragon / webhook) run **degraded
in the sandbox**, not broken. Known UX follow-ups remain (below).

## In flight (verify against live GitHub)

**Do not trust a hard-coded PR count here — it goes stale on every push.** Get the
real list at session start from live GitHub (`list_pull_requests`, state=open);
this snapshot deliberately names no open PRs. For an initiative's shipped/queued
status read its tracker (e.g. the server-management tracker), not this section.
Source code and merged PRs win over anything written here.

## Recently shipped (newest first)

> Convention: **merged PRs only** (with #numbers). In-flight work is *not* listed here —
> get it from live GitHub. The newest merge a session sees may not be added yet; that
> lag is expected (the next session reconciles). A merged PR tagged "pending" is the bug.

  **deathmatch `_DuelView` double-write** (SettleOnceMixin retrofit mirroring the bot-duel sibling),
  the **blackjack FREE-tournament double-pay** (claim past the all-finished check; the free leg has
  no escrow rows so the claim is its only guard), and a **third instance found during verification —
  the RPS free-tournament payout race** (per-tournament claim via the new
  `SettleOnceMixin.rearm_settlement()` seam); `check_consistency` **Rule 6 widened** (cogs/ root +
  `payout_tournament`/`update_leaderboard` sinks) so the checker now catches this non-adopter class;
  8 concurrency + 4 checker regressions. **#1782** wired the ready-but-unwired
  `economy_service.transfer()` to **`!pay`/`!transfer`** (NOT `give` — banned token Q-0211), guard
  rails + sibling embed idiom + regenerated command-surface artifacts, **live-exercised against real

  agents decide reversible-until-a-gate calls themselves with recommend+rationale+flag rather than
  routing them up; the safety brake reframed so only *executing* something irreversible before the gate
  stops-and-waits) + the surgical `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Act-vs-ask clarification + the Fable brief revision
  folding in the decide-and-flag model and the foundational-completeness scope; **#1770** executed the

- **#1736 · #1737 · #1739 (2026-07-05, S5/CI — CI-setup redesign: brief → divergence analysis → Phase-A hard merge gates)** —
  the CI-setup redesign arc (#1736 brief → #1737 best-possible-CI-for-current-bot + fresh-repo divergence
  analysis, `planning/ci-setup-redesign-2026-07-05.md`, shipping `check_workflow_concurrency` advisory).
  **#1739 Phase-A** promoted three should-gate-but-didn't invariants to **hard merge gates** by adding
  them to the already-required `code-quality` context (reversible, no branch-protection change):
  `check_architecture --mode strict` (layer boundaries — previously only a local Stop hook),
  `check_tool_pins` (formatter-pin drift, reached `main` in #1315), `check_workflow_concurrency` (the
  #1275 head-run-cancel race) + flipped `codeql.yml` to `cancel-in-progress: false`; each verified green
  on `main` first. Remainder proposed as router Q-0238(C)/Q-0239.
- **#1712 · #1719 (2026-07-04, workflow — 34th Q-0107 reconciliation pass + open-PR review/merge sweep)** —
  the **thirty-fourth Q-0107 docs-only reconciliation pass** (band-#1710,
  [pass record](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-07-04-band1710.md), #1712) and the **open-PR review +
  merge sweep** (#1719) that dispositioned the backlog of Codex review docs #1695–#1699 + the dependabot
  batch #1555…#1560/#1720 onto `main`.
- **#1714 · #1715 · #1717 · #1718 · #1722 · #1723 · #1724 · #1726 · #1727 · #1729 · #1731 · #1732 · #1733 · #1734 · #1738 · #1740 (2026-07-04/06, docs — dashboard-data refreshes, Q-0167)** —
  sixteen per-source-merge **dashboard-data refreshes** keeping the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json`
  export fresh as the S3 rebuild Gate-0/Stage-2 arc, the save-fixes runtime change, and the CI redesign landed.
- **#1695 · #1696 · #1697 · #1698 · #1699 (2026-07-03/04, S3 rebuild — five Codex rebuild-planning reviews, merged via the open-PR sweep #1719)** —
  the owner-launched Codex review fan-out over the 2026-07-03 Phase-A corpus, merged after
  verification + fixes (badge `review`→`audit`, reachability links, and a **post-review status note**
  on each — all five were written *before* the design bridge #1708 and the Gate-0 freeze #1716, so
  their still-open items must be reconciled against the Gate-0 packet before acting): the
  **planning sanity review** (#1695 — gate/phase map verified, no blocking inconsistency, stale-claim
  table); the **decision-log consistency review** (#1696 — conflict table incl. authority-vocabulary /
  C-1-status / preset-semantics rows, missing-durable-home + vocabulary-normalization tables, 10 owner
  questions); the **foundational-mechanics ultracode review** (#1697 — Prompt A trust **high**, 10
  source-verified samples); the **Stage-2 readiness review** (#1698 — subsystem-walk contract +
  template, normalized verdict vocabulary, lane split); and the **verification review** (#1699 —
  10 missing oracle/checker classes, 6 acceptance-criteria rewrites, block-Phase-B checker-spec list).
  The stale June **unfinished-work audit #1509** (already harvested by #1510; its top finding since
  resolved) was **closed with reason**, per the band-#1530 pass disposition.
- **#1555 · #1556 · #1557 · #1558 · #1559 · #1560 · #1720 (2026-07-04, deps — dependabot batch, merged via the open-PR sweep #1719)** —
  the six stale (5-day-old) dependabot PRs dispositioned: fastapi 0.138.2 → **0.139.0** + uvicorn
  **0.50** (dashboard + botsite), openai ≥2.44, **Pillow 11 → 12** (major; CI-proven on the bumped
  install + render tests re-verified locally on 12.3 against today's main), asyncpg ≥0.31,
  prometheus-client ≥0.25, grimp 3.15. #1556 was fixed rather than rubber-stamped: dependabot had
  bumped `requirements-dev.txt`'s tool pins alone (the #1074/#1315 drift class the `tool-pins` check
  caught), so the sweep did the deliberate **three-place toolchain bump** — **ruff 0.15.20 · pytest
  9.1.1 · pytest-xdist 3.8.0** aligned across `code-quality.yml` / `requirements-dev.txt` /
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — verified by the full local CI mirror (14 059 passed) + one ERA001
  prose-comment fix in `botsite/app.py`. Conflict-rotted #1560 and the recreated group PR #1720
  were conflict-resolved on-branch and merged on green.
- **#1689 · #1690 · #1691 · #1693 · #1700 · #1701 · #1703 · #1704 · #1705 (2026-07-03, S3 rebuild — foundations audit → Fable-5 judgment → design-prep, Q-0236/Q-0237)** —
  the pre-Phase-B foundations arc that dominated the band: the **engine-room audit** (PROMPT A,
  #1690 — a 75-agent ultracode discovery+audit of the runtime/logic foundation, 18 → 35 mechanics,
  each with a how-now (`file:line`) + 2–3 alternatives + pressure-test, adversarially verified vs
  shipped source per Q-0120) and the **surface + proving audit** (PROMPT B, #1691 — 46
  presentation/UX + verification mechanics); the **two confirmed prod loss-path fixes** the
  engine-room audit surfaced (#1693 — blackjack tournament entry-fee forfeit on a VERSION bump +
  XP double-fire during the deploy-handoff overlap, the band's only runtime change); the **Fable-5
  capstone final judgment** over all 2026-07-03 Phase-A work (#1700 prepare prompt → #1701 verdict:
  *engine-rich · grammar-thin · oracle-empty*), which produced the **7 Tier-1 owner decisions**
  (#1703, Q-0237) and captured **2 owner ideas** (#1704 — in-server release→test→verify loop +
  websites cutover-role); plus the prep of the **foundational-design opus ultracode prompt** (#1705,
  now executing in #1708) and ultracode quick-launch prompts (#1689).
- **#1682 (2026-07-03, workflow — thirty-third Q-0107 reconciliation pass, band-#1680)** — the
  thirty-third Q-0107 docs-only reconciliation + planning pass
  ([pass record](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-07-03-band1680.md)): reconciled band
  #1651–#1680, trimmed Recently-shipped to 20, disposed 7 open PRs, confirmed the control-plane,
  refreshed the dashboard export, reset the marker #1650 → #1680.
- **#1692 · #1694 · #1702 · #1706 · #1707 · #1709 · #1710 (2026-07-03/04, docs — dashboard-data refreshes, Q-0167)** —
  seven per-source-merge **dashboard-data refreshes** keeping the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json`
  export fresh as the S3 rebuild foundations arc landed.
- **#1688 (2026-07-03, S3 rebuild — two parallel ultracode prompts prepared, Q-0236)** —
  owner-directed preparation (not launched): [two paste-ready ultracode session
  prompts](planning/rebuild-foundational-mechanics-ultracode-brief-2026-07-03.md) to brainstorm +
  audit every foundational mechanic (use-now + could-use) against today's decisions — session A =
  runtime/logic engine room, session B = presentation/UX + verification — disjoint scopes,
  rubric-scored issues ledgers, each its own claim + PR. Owner sends them in parallel; survivors
  feed the Stage-2 walk / Gate-V fleet.
- **#1687 (2026-07-03, S3 rebuild — unified layout-success simulator idea, Q-0235)** —
  captured the idea to unify the 5 bespoke UX-layout sims into one **instruction-driven
  layout-success simulator** (deterministic + AI user models; "create roles" → does a user model
  reach the right node?) that quantifies the "self-explanatory" half of the Q-0234 oracle and is
  the mechanism behind "sim optimizes arrangement" (Q-0230); sim defines settings bot-wide, live
  co-test is the final review.
- **#1686 (2026-07-03, S3 rebuild — new-feature oracle + verification-fleet gate + repo-as-artifact strategy, Q-0234)** —
  resolved the rubric's class-8 verification hole: the correctness oracle = parity goldens (ported) +
  **competitor-benchmark & live co-test** ("works · logical · self-explanatory", reusing the Q-0222
  `verified_live` sign-off) for new features. Recorded **Gate V** (a multi-agent verification-fleet
  pass over the finished plan, using the ten-class rubric as its shared lens) between Phase A and
  Phase B, and the **migration-as-its-own-plan / repo-as-artifact** framing (current repo = what/why/
  how artifact; new repo = clean source of truth) in the phase sequence.
- **#1685 (2026-07-03, S3 rebuild — the critical-review rubric, Q-0233)** —
  owner-directed [reusable review lens](planning/rebuild-critical-review-rubric-2026-07-03.md): the
  ten gap-classes caught reviewing the rebuild plan this session (dependency-order inversion,
  forgotten capability, thin step, stale un-anchored claim, fragmentation, under-generalization,
  missing standard, verification hole, UX-contract gap, naming/collision) turned into probing
  questions with mechanization tags — run against every subsystem in the Stage-2 walk + every
  Phase-B plan (it *is* the adversarial-completeness checklist). Mechanizable classes routed as a
  [checker backlog](ideas/rebuild-critical-review-checkers-2026-07-03.md).
- **#1684 (2026-07-03, S3 rebuild — Phase-A hub topology + navigation contract + interface presets, Q-0230…Q-0232)** —
  owner-live [hub/navigation decisions log](planning/rebuild-hub-navigation-presets-2026-07-03.md):
  one **unified help hub** (admin a permission-gated node + `!admin` direct-open, re-checked at
  click time); the **navigation contract** (Back+Home injected into every rendered state, every
  node directly openable by command, **persistent restart-safe panels** that also survive the
  merge=deploy redeploys); and **per-guild interface presets** with live preview — verified as an
  existing-but-fragmented surface (setup preset_select + help overlay editor + ~7 preset impls) to
  be improved + centralized onto one preset/template primitive (C-3). Open: preset exclusion =
  hide-vs-disable.
- **Older merges (#1680 … #535) → [`current-state-archive.md`](current-state-archive.md).** Recently-shipped keeps the ~20 newest; older entries are trimmed to the archive (newest-first), which `scripts/check_docs.py` soft-ratchets at 20 and `check_current_state_ledger.py` treats as present. *(Thematic grouping by date means the live/archive PR-number spans overlap slightly — the floor pointer is approximate prose, not a strict bound; the per-band pass records carry the exact moved sets.)* *(The twenty-first Q-0107 pass — band-#1320, 2026-06-22 — added the band #1294–#1320 work as seven grouped entries (fishing minigame #1296/#1298/#1299/#1301/#1303/#1304, role management #1300/#1302/#1306, help surface #1294/#1297, BTD6 answerability #1295/#1316, botsite React PR1 #1305, CI/ledger/tool-pin hygiene #1308/#1317/#1320, dependency bumps + dashboard #1307/#1309/#1311/#1312/#1313/#1314/#1315); trimmed the live ledger to 20, moving #1208-band · #1226-band · #1211-band · #1210 · #1203-band · #1209-band · #1183-band to the archive.)* *(The twentieth Q-0107 pass — band-#1290, 2026-06-22 — added the band #1265–#1291 work as six grouped entries; trimmed the live ledger to 20, moving #1186 · #1156-band · #1147-band · #1143-band · #1162-band · #1149-band to the archive.)*

## Next candidates

- **Website two-site split — rollout + next steps:**
  [`operations/website-split-next-steps-2026-06-19.md`](operations/website-split-next-steps-2026-06-19.md)
  is the live handoff: the v1 build is **code-complete + reviewed** (#1109–#1119, hardened by #1122), and
  what remains is the owner-paced **rollout** (provision `botsite/` + the submissions DB, then domain
  cutover), the 3 review flags (moderation race · web-CI matrix · idea→subsystem mapping), and two
  security-review-gated slices (control-panel migration · live status aggregator).
- **Cross-area sequencing + the plan index now live in [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md)**
  (by area, with Now / Next / Later / Someday horizons + gates — where to find which plan
  for which part of the code). The picks below are the current top of that list.
- Server-management is **structurally complete** *(bullet corrected 2026-06-10 — it
  still queued PR14 long after the hub merged)*: **PR10 complete** (six slices,
  ADR-008), **PR11** (#570; governance section **deferred** — revisit only with a
  scope decision), **PR12** (2026-06-07), **PR13's deterministic slice** (2026-06-08,
  incl. the migration-059 staging fix), and **PR14 — the unified Server Management
  Hub — shipped 2026-06-08 via #584**. The only remainder is the **gated PR13 AI
  generation layer**. The `docs/planning/server-management-status-2026-06-05.md`
  tracker (re-badged `historical` 2026-06-13 — initiative complete) is the historical
  record; the gated PR13 AI tail lives in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) → Later. Don't duplicate it here.
- Health/diagnostics maintainer live-tests (production AI tool + grouped findings):
  see `docs/subsystems/health-diagnostics.md`.
- **Docs consolidation (Q-0010) — executed 2026-06-08.** Top-level `docs/` is now **16**
  (the 13 binding contracts + `current-state` + `roadmap` + `context-map-tooling`); plans /
  audits / inventories / historical snapshots moved into clustered subdirs behind their
  folios, and `_TOP_LEVEL_DOCS_BUDGET` lowered 41 → 16. Paired with the idea-backlog
  lifecycle + grooming secondary task (Q-0015, `docs/ideas/README.md`) and the binding-doc
  section-ownership convention (`docs/owner/ai-project-workflow.md` §9). The original handoff
  was [`planning/docs-restructure-brief-2026-06-08.md`](planning/docs-restructure-brief-2026-06-08.md).

## Gates / blocked work

- **Autonomous loop — see the canonical [Control-plane state table](operations/autonomous-routines.md)
  § "Control-plane state".** That table is the single source of truth for the loop's state (does it
  self-fire · `ROUTINE_PAT` · Railway env · dispatch-prompt version · model pins); **do not restate
  its verdict here.** This bullet is a pure pointer on purpose — a control-plane verdict copied into
  this file drifted from the canonical table twice (the band-#870 and band-#930 passes each had to
  re-sync it by hand), so the copy is deliberately gone (idea
  `control-plane-single-source-pointer-2026-06-15`). The live read no in-repo checker can see is the
  `reconcile` trigger-issue author (`menno420` = PAT set & loop self-fires; `github-actions[bot]` =
  PAT unset); `check_loop_health.py` (Q-0135) probes live GitHub for the same truth.
- **Open bugs (bug book):** **BUG-0009** (AI list-answer mislabeling — needs the AI orchestration §7
  deterministic list-builders, plan-level) and **BUG-0011** (Hermes gateway restart crash-loop — needs
  a clean VPS foreground repro) stay OPEN — [`health/bug-book.md`](health/bug-book.md).
- **Open decisions:** **Q-0096** remainder (Context7 adopted #737; **Postgres-MCP + `pyright-lsp`**
  undecided) · **Q-0120/Q-0121** (the workflow pass's proposals — candidate-rule promotion · Hermes
  bug-triage `gh issue create` write). *(**Q-0119 answered 2026-06-13** → governance role pointers
  get their own reserved-namespace `governance` schema home (option a); P0-3 family 3 is unblocked
  for a future arc PR — router §Q-0119 + the [convergence plan §5](planning/settings-pointer-lane-convergence-plan-2026-06-13.md).)*
- **AI / BTD6 feature expansion — re-postured 2026-06-09 (Q-0048):** AI tools that are
  **read-only AND deterministic** (no writes, no external calls, audience-tiered) carry a
  **standing lift** and may ship without a per-case ask. Anything that **writes, costs
  money, calls external services, or adds UI** still needs the per-exposure lift, and broad
  expansion stays gated on *all* of: bot-wide stability **+** provider/provenance checks
  **+** caching / source-health clarity **+** AI behavior/config correctness.
- **BTD6 data extraction** — ADR-006 provenance schema **now implemented**
  (`docs/btd6/btd6-provenance-schema.md`); extraction may resume against the ordered
  backlog in `docs/btd6/btd6-gamedata-decode-status.md`. The broader AI/BTD6
  feature-expansion gate (stability + provider/provenance + caching + AI config) still
  applies.
- `_derive_scope` → `PLATFORM_OWNER` (decision D1) — **RESOLVED** in #541; owner-only
  AI tools are now reachable.

## Known UX follow-ups (not stability bugs)

- Server-management member/role UX follow-ups: see
  `docs/subsystems/server-management.md`.
- Dense DiagnosticCog platform-subview pagination idea: see
  `docs/subsystems/health-diagnostics.md`.

## Near-term technical debt (decided, not yet implemented)

*(The Q-0025 `new_subsystem.py` scaffold that used to sit here is reconciled: built
and used to register Community Spotlight in **#626** (execution-plan Lane 1,
2026-06-09 — verify merged on live GitHub).)*

*(The Q-0026 `cog_name_to_subsystem` fix that used to sit here is reconciled: merged
in **#588**, listed under Recently shipped.)*

## Off-limits / do-not-propose

- No Redis / external state store (**ADR-001**).
- Game state is **not** restart-safe by design (**ADR-002**) — accepted, not a bug.
- Do not re-litigate the rejection ledger in
  `docs/planning/superbot-ideas-lab-2026-06-05.md` §6.
- Do not restate "bot fully tested & working" as *newly* verified without an actual
  boot + live walk — cite the #535 baseline instead.
- **No monetization that gates features** — no paywalls, premium/VIP feature tiers, freemium
  feature-gating, subscriptions, or pay-to-win (**Q-0190 North Star: free for everyone, forever**;
  generalizes Q-0039 no-P2W / no-billing). The *only* allowed money surface is a voluntary
  *zero-benefit* support/sponsor link to offset hosting + AI cost. Full statement:
  [`ideas/free-for-everyone-mission-2026-06-21.md`](ideas/free-for-everyone-mission-2026-06-21.md).

## Where to read next

The **canonical read path + "what lives where"** lives in
**`docs/AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`** ("Reading order by task" + the document-classification
lists). This file is *step 3* of that path: read it for **what is true right now**, then
follow the orientation route for your task. The read-path table is **not** duplicated
here — one canonical home (`AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`).

**One-fact-one-home rule:** if a fact belongs in one of those homes, **link** to it —
do not restate it here. Restatement across files is where drift breeds. In particular,
**don't summarize plans'/trackers' PR numbers or status here** — link to the folio or
tracker, which is authoritative for its own area.
