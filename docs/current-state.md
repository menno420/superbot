Also decided: BTD6 data-refresh automation = **manual-dispatch workflow** (Q-0049 — **built same day in #633**, execution-plan Lane 5: `workflow_dispatch`-only, opens a reviewable PR, never pushes to main); mining descent lights **permanent, owner-confirmed** (Q-0050); the five product-vision questions (Q-0038–Q-0042) got their **draft-answer session** (Q-0051) **and the maintainer marked all five up same day (Lane 6, PR #631, structured choices)**: Q-0038 server-scoped clans, Q-0039 cosmetic-only donations (no bot-side billing), Q-0041 YouTube-first/dual-opt-in/voice-deferred, Q-0042 staged-Someday website — all approved as drafted; **Q-0040 adjusted: the AI dungeon master picks quests/rewards/difficulty from bounded, hard-capped menus** (not pure narration, not free-form authority). Posture decisions only — every lane still needs its own plan/promotion + the AI per-exposure lift; conclusions routed to the four roadmap drafts + router §21.

## Stability baseline

Operational stability **accepted after #535** (live cog walk: server-management,
economy, moderation, games, hub navigation). **Do not run a broad re-audit unless
a regression is reported** — this is an *accepted baseline*, not a fresh re-test.
Env-gated features (AI / scheduler / YouTube / Paragon / webhook) run **degraded
in the sandbox**, not broken. Known UX follow-ups remain (below).

## In flight (verify against live GitHub)

**Do not trust a hard-coded PR count here — it goes stale on every push.** Get the
real list at session start from live GitHub (`list_pull_requests`, state=open);
this snapshot deliberately names no open PRs. For an initiative's shipped/queued
status read its tracker (e.g. the server-management tracker), not this section.
Source code and merged PRs win over anything written here.

## Recently shipped (newest first)

> Convention: **merged PRs only** (with #numbers). In-flight work is *not* listed here —
> get it from live GitHub. The newest merge a session sees may not be added yet; that
> lag is expected (the next session reconciles). A merged PR tagged "pending" is the bug.

- **#1919 (2026-07-10, overnight shift B — claim visibility across un-merged branches)** —
  `check_lane_overlap.py --remote` scans recent un-merged `origin/claude/*` / `origin/bot/*`
  branch tips for `docs/owner/claims/` files not on `main` (tip-state `ls-tree` compare —
  shallow-clone-safe, degrades gracefully offline), so a sibling session's claim is visible
  **before its PR exists** — closing the pre-PR race window of a parallel wave
  (idea `claim-remote-visibility-scan-2026-07-08`, now shipped; +5 unit tests, protocol line
  in `docs/owner/claims/README.md`). Ride-alongs: Recently-shipped trimmed to the 20 ratchet,
  fresh-container dev-tools bootstrap row in the journal ⚡ Quick reference (Q-0194). Tooling/docs-only.
- **#1918 (2026-07-10, tooling — static command-collision checker)** — new
  `scripts/check_command_collisions.py` + 18-test suite: pure-stdlib AST walk over `disbot/cogs/**`
  that fails when two declarations claim the same top-level command name/alias within a namespace
  (prefix registry incl. aliases · slash tree incl. `app_commands.Group` assignments) — the static,
  pre-merge half of the #1541/#1544 `give`-collision prod-outage guard (the #1544 boot guard stays
  the runtime backstop). Live tree at ship: 403 token claims, 0 collisions; a standing
  `test_live_tree_has_zero_collisions` regression runs in every pytest pass. Q-0105 unverified-tier
  header; `code-quality.yml` step wiring deliberately deferred (noted in the idea file).
- **#1917 (2026-07-10, codex — docstring)** — codex-authored one-liner adding a return description
  to `format_duration` in `disbot/utils/duration.py`; verified accurate against source (Q-0120) and
  merged on green CI by the overnight session (codex branches don't auto-arm, so it was merged
  directly after confirming green on head).
- **#1913 (2026-07-09/10, EAP — independent fleet wind-down audit)** — a fresh `superbot`
  session ran an adversarial, evidence-based audit of the 2026-07-09 gen-1 fleet wind-down:
  cloned all 9 EAP repos fresh, then had one agent per lane read its succession package and
  a **separate** agent per cited incident try to refute it against live GitHub PR/commit/CI
  data. Result: all 7 wind-down lanes (substrate-kit, websites, trading-strategy, the three
  codetool-lab arms, superbot-games/exploration) shipped complete, substantive succession
  packages — 21/21 spot-checked incidents resolved to real evidence, zero fabricated content
  found — plus the new `venture-lab` seed (11/11 files, genuinely lesson-derived, not
  boilerplate). Five real (non-fabrication) inaccuracies surfaced and are logged with exact
  evidence; the most consequential is inside **fleet-manager's own ping-test report**, which
  falsely claims `websites` never acknowledged a coordination test — a real, delayed ack
  (PR #44, +1h39m) contradicts it. Full report:
  [`eap/fleet-winddown-audit-2026-07-09.md`](eap/fleet-winddown-audit-2026-07-09.md). Also
  groomed the `cross-repo-eap-verification-orientation-pointer` idea into a new
  `AGENT_ORIENTATION.md` task route, having just lived the exact flow. Docs-only.
- **#1864 · #1866 · #1867 · #1868 (2026-07-08/09, S3 rebuild / EAP — the Anthropic-feedback email assembled + sent, close-out)** —
  the owner's Friday Anthropic feedback email reached final form and was sent: **#1864** assembled the full
  two-part email (landed Menno's **Part 1**, made the agent **Part 2** complementary), **#1866** signed Part 2
  as Claude (two-author sign-off), **#1867** closed out the projects-testing feedback thread, and **#1868**
  shipped the **rebuild-direction handoff + marked the EAP email sent**. Docs-only.
- **#1873 · #1874 · #1875 · #1876 · #1877 · #1887 · #1889 · #1890 (2026-07-08/09, S3 rebuild — EAP Project fleet founding → independent fleet review)** —
  the Claude Code Projects (EAP) fleet grew to **four repos** (`superbot`, `superbot-next`, `substrate-kit`,
  `websites`) and got an oversight layer: **#1877** added the **EAP Project fleet plan** (7 domain projects +
  3-model comparison + kit-lab), **#1874** a **second Project** kickoff (rebuild status site + Railway test),
  **#1876** the **websites Project** kickoff (superseding the draft), **#1873** the **rebuild-Project audit
  checklist** (+ a planning/README homing fix, Q-0166), **#1875** updated the settings ledger (rulesets now
  live on `superbot-next` + `substrate-kit`). **#1887/#1889/#1890** ran the **independent cross-repo fleet
  review** ([`eap/fleet-review-2026-07-09.md`](eap/fleet-review-2026-07-09.md) — honest verdict + first-party
  clone-and-run verification: `superbot-next` 998 pass / 1 skip under Py3.11) and the **manager-Project brief**.
  Headline finding: the substrate-kit's **render/engage half strands in every fresh adoption** (`adopt`
  plants-but-doesn't-render/wire) — an upstream-kit fix, captured for kit-lab. Docs-only.
  **Follow-on (2026-07-10):** an independent **gen-1 → gen-2 doctrine review** comparing the new
  `fleet-manager` doctrine against superbot's original
  ([`eap/gen1-gen2-doctrine-review-2026-07-10.md`](eap/gen1-gen2-doctrine-review-2026-07-10.md) —
  verified against both repos at HEAD; headline: gen-2 kept the hard-won machinery, but its
  reconciliation gate is hollow and one env-secrets rule contradicts itself). Docs-only.
- **#1878 · #1879 · #1881 · #1882 · #1883 · #1884 (2026-07-08/09, S3 — substrate-kit graduated to its own repo; superbot as first consumer + kit-lab companions)** —
  the substrate-kit **graduated to [menno420/substrate-kit](https://github.com/menno420/substrate-kit)** (v1.0.0)
  and superbot became its first downstream consumer: **#1878** substrate-kit planning, **#1879** pinned the kit
  via a root **`substrate.config.json`** (`kit_version: 1.0.0`, kit-lab founding-plan §4.2 consumer half),
  **#1882** **removed the in-tree `substrate-kit/` + `tests/unit/substrate_kit/` copy** (101 files; the kit now
  lives upstream), **#1881** added **program-law provenance riders** (PL-001…PL-009) to the eight origin Q-blocks
  in the router (KL-2 companion), **#1883** shipped the exporter **`telemetry` family** in
  `export_dashboard_data.py` (KL-6 companion — reads `telemetry/model-usage.jsonl`, field-whitelisted, fail-open),
  and **#1884** pinned the **`console.json` cross-repo shape contract**. Docs/tooling only (no `disbot/`).
- **#1886 (2026-07-09, S5/ops — Dependabot PR policy, owner decision Q-0256)** —
  captured the owner's **review-on-sight dependabot rule** (durable home
  [`operations/repo-settings-state.md`](operations/repo-settings-state.md) § Dependabot PR policy; the
  not-shipped auto-arm alternative is Q-0257) and executed the **backlog review/merge of #1761–#1766**
  (see the entry below).
- **#1863 (2026-07-08, workflow — thirty-ninth Q-0107 reconciliation pass, band-#1860)** —
  the 39th docs-only reconciliation + planning pass
  ([pass record](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-07-08-band1860.md)): reconciled band #1831–#1861, trimmed
  Recently-shipped to 20, disposed the open-PR set, confirmed the control-plane, refreshed the dashboard
  export, reset the marker #1830 → #1861.
- **#1865 · #1869 · #1870 · #1871 · #1872 · #1880 · #1885 · #1888 (2026-07-08/09, docs — dashboard-data refreshes, Q-0167)** —
  eight per-source-merge refreshes keeping the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json` export fresh as the
  EAP-email / fleet-founding / substrate-kit-graduation arc landed.
- **#1762 · #1763 · #1764 · #1765 · #1766 (2026-07-09, dependabot backlog cleared under the new Q-0256 policy)** —
  the six stuck dependabot PRs (opened 2026-07-06, CI-green ~3 days with no merge actor — `dependabot/*`
  branches are never armed by the enabler, by design) were reviewed and dispositioned per the owner's
  new **review-on-sight rule (Q-0256**, durable home `docs/operations/repo-settings-state.md`
  § Dependabot PR policy**)**: **#1764** discord.py ≥2.7.1, **#1763** anthropic ≥0.116, **#1766**
  Pillow ≥12.3, **#1762** uvicorn 0.50.2 (botsite + dashboard lockfile) — all floor/patch bumps fresh
  builds already resolved; **#1765** psutil ≥7.2.2 (**major** 5→7) merged after a real breaking-change
  assessment (only `Process().memory_info().rss` / `cpu_percent()` / `virtual_memory()` used — all
  unchanged through 7.2.x; removed APIs unused; full suite green with 7.2.2 installed). **#1761 closed**
  as a strict subset of #1762 (both bumped the same `dashboard/requirements.*` lines). Policy Q-block +
  the not-shipped auto-arm alternative: router Q-0256/Q-0257 (session PR #1886).
- **#1834 · #1837 · #1838 · #1839 · #1840 · #1842 · #1847 · #1852 · #1853 · #1856 · #1858 · #1859 · #1861 (2026-07-07/08, S3 rebuild / EAP-evaluation — the Anthropic-feedback email + permission-probe arc)** —
  the band's headline: the coordinator kickoff continued (**#1834/#1837**) and the EAP evaluation produced
  the owner's **Friday Anthropic feedback email**, refined across the band with **every claim audited to a
  verifiable test** (**#1838** compaction + verifiability audit → **#1840** two-layer clear-path flagship
  (classifier-vs-credential) → **#1853** refresh + forward-only Project custom instructions → **#1856**
  two-part / two-author / two-reviewer restructure → **#1858** Part-2 first-person agent narrative). The
  **permission-probe** thread hardened the central finding: the auto-mode first-publish push wall is
  **`git push`-transport-specific** — the **GitHub Contents API bootstraps a fresh empty public repo
  prompt-free** (**#1847** — both `substrate-kit` + `superbot-next` seeded, likely unblocking rebuild step 7),
  with the clear-path (**#1839**) and standing-grant-row (**#1842**) addenda. **#1852** = the EAP-direction
  handoff; **#1859** = the campaign self-audit (coordinator same-day recall graded **≈0.98 precision / ~1.0
  event-level recall** vs git ground truth, 6 friction entries logged); **#1861** = the projects-testing
  Anthropic-feedback close-out. Docs-only throughout (no `disbot/`).
- **#1844 · #1850 · #1851 (2026-07-08, S1 — server-management subsystem audit → Wave-2 docs truth refresh)** —
  the owner's campaign Wave-2 over the server-management subsystem: **#1844** ran the audit; **#1851**
  shipped the **docs truth refresh** (findings F1–F5 reconciled in `docs/subsystems/server-management.md`);
  **#1850** added the **W2-F6 AST write-boundary invariant** for the reaction-role tables (a new checker +
  tests — tooling/tests only, no `disbot/` runtime).
- **#1843 · #1848 · #1849 (2026-07-08, S5/ops — per-repo settings ledger: forward-only Project experiment)** —
  a readable per-repo settings ledger so future sessions **read state, not guess**: **#1843** captured the
  forward-only Project experiment idea + the ledger plan; **#1848** shipped **Phase 1** — the `superbot-next`
  General settings captured from the owner's screen recording (frames extracted via a dev-only
  `imageio-ffmpeg`) into [`operations/repo-settings-state.md`](operations/repo-settings-state.md); **#1849**
  corrected it (new repos are **bare** + the full auto-mode API capability map). Phase 2 (a generator that
  auto-maintains the rows) stays queued.
- **#1845 · #1846 · #1854 · #1855 (2026-07-08, S4/workflow — grooming waves: idea→plan + friction→guard)** —
  the campaign's grooming lanes, all idea-lifecycle / self-improvement: **#1845** (lane C) promoted the
  **usage-limit-aware routines** idea → a 2-PR plan + roadmap S5 horizon; **#1846** (lane B) shipped the
  **supersede-banner integrity checker** (`scripts/check_supersede_integrity.py` + a warn-first `check_docs`
  soft check, 16 tests); **#1854** groomed the #1846 follow-ons; **#1855** closed the "green-by-skip" gap by
  wiring **`check_plan_homing --strict` as an always-run pre-setup gate** in `code-quality.yml` so the
  docs-only fast path can no longer land an unhomed plan (Q-0194 friction→guard).
- **#1833 (2026-07-08, workflow — thirty-eighth Q-0107 reconciliation pass, band-#1830)** —
  the 38th docs-only reconciliation + planning pass
  ([pass record](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-07-08-band1830.md)): reconciled band #1801–#1830,
  trimmed Recently-shipped to 20, disposed the open-PR set (6 dependabot bumps in flight), confirmed the
  control-plane, refreshed the dashboard export, reset the marker #1800 → #1830.
- **#1835 · #1836 · #1841 (2026-07-07/08, docs — dashboard-data refreshes, Q-0167)** —
  three per-source-merge refreshes keeping the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json` export fresh as the
  EAP-email / settings-ledger / grooming arc landed.
- **#1807 · #1810 · #1811 · #1812 · #1813 · #1814 · #1816 · #1817 · #1818 · #1819 · #1820 · #1821 · #1822 · #1823 · #1825 · #1826 · #1827 · #1828 · #1829 · #1830 (2026-07-07/08, S3 rebuild — the SuperBot Project coordinator kickoff → live calibration → EAP-evaluation arc)** —
  the band's headline: the **Claude Code Projects (EAP) coordinator went live** and ran the rebuild
  program's first stretch. **#1807/#1810** stood up the early-access / repo-first kickoff (owner creates
  `superbot-next` first, multi-repo picker test) + fixed pre-existing badge/plan-homing drift on sight
  (#1808, Q-0166). **#1811…#1823** rewrote the [coordinator kickoff + calibration doc](planning/projects-eap-coordinator-kickoff-2026-07-07.md)
  through ~13 owner-steered addenda — thin pointer-first Custom Instructions, the 13-item **calibration
  exchange** (the coordinator scored a strong pass, Q7 verified against live GitHub), the **SECOND MANDATE**
  evaluation guidebook (**#1820** — the Projects-EAP journal + seven EAP axes, so the Project both *executes*
  the rebuild and *evaluates Claude Code Projects* for the owner's standing-Anthropic-channel goal), tempo
  correction (3-day free-window *stretch goal*, correctness first), the Q-0247 kit-extraction sequence made
  explicit, the don't-spare-on-agents fan-out mandate, and the §7 **working-relationship inquiry** →
  a durable operating model (kickoff §8). **The EAP findings for the owner's Friday Anthropic feedback**
  (the evaluation's whole point) landed across #1821…#1830: the **auto-mode permission / consent-wall**
  (falsified-then-corrected several times as the owner probed the UI — headline = the first-publish push
  wall is likely **un-self-clearable in cloud Projects** (auto-mode-only, no permissions UI)); the
  **secrets-field** thread raised → recalibrated → **dropped as a non-incident** (#1826/#1827/#1828, owner
  editorial call — feedback stays incident-backed only); the **4 KiB `start_project_session` dispatch cap**
  (#1829); and the direct **11-test permission-boundary probe report** (**#1830** — constructive/reversible
  actions run prompt-free, destructive-git-to-a-published-ref is hard-walled with no self-clear path).
  Docs-only throughout (no `disbot/`). ⚑ Owner-parked: the step-7 first-publish push and the stranded
  scratch branch `test/permprobe-0708` (harmless; auto mode can't self-delete a remote ref).
- **#1806 · #1809 (2026-07-07, workflow — Q-0254 understand-and-reflect rule → portable kit doctrine)** —
  graduated the **understand-and-reflect** working-agreement rule (state back the fuller picture + implied
  specs before substantive work; surface the possibility space when feasibility is uncertain) into the
  portable **substrate-kit** templates (`CONSTITUTION.md.tmpl` + `collaboration-model.md.tmpl` +
  `question-router.md.tmpl`) so it travels to every future repo, with superbot's local `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  copy kept in sync. Docs/kit-template only.
- **#1802 · #1804 (2026-07-07, S3 rebuild — program founding briefs: website-design + kit-lab)** —
  two of the Q-0252 three-program-sessions founding artifacts closed out: the **website-design brief**
  (#1802 — verification record + proof screenshots, docs homing, card flipped green) and the **kit-lab
  founding brief** (#1804). Part of the [three-program-sessions launch](planning/program-three-sessions-launch-index-2026-07-07.md).
- **#1801 · #1803 (2026-07-07, workflow — thirty-seventh Q-0107 reconciliation pass, band-#1800)** —
  the 37th docs-only reconciliation + planning pass
  ([pass record](planning/reconciliation-pass-2026-07-07-band1800.md)): reconciled band #1771–#1800,
  trimmed Recently-shipped to 20, closed the 5 consumed Codex Gate-V evidence PRs, confirmed the
  control-plane, refreshed the dashboard export, reset the marker #1770 → #1800.
- **#1805 · #1815 · #1824 (2026-07-07/08, docs — dashboard-data refreshes, Q-0167)** —
  three per-source-merge refreshes keeping the committed `dashboard/data/dashboard.json` export fresh as
  the coordinator-kickoff / EAP-evaluation arc landed.
- **Older merges (#1799 … #535) → [`current-state-archive.md`](current-state-archive.md).** Recently-shipped keeps the ~20 newest; older entries are trimmed to the archive (newest-first), which `scripts/check_docs.py` soft-ratchets at 20 and `check_current_state_ledger.py` treats as present. *(Thematic grouping by date means the live/archive PR-number spans overlap slightly — the floor pointer is approximate prose, not a strict bound; the per-band pass records carry the exact moved sets.)* *(The twenty-first Q-0107 pass — band-#1320, 2026-06-22 — added the band #1294–#1320 work as seven grouped entries (fishing minigame #1296/#1298/#1299/#1301/#1303/#1304, role management #1300/#1302/#1306, help surface #1294/#1297, BTD6 answerability #1295/#1316, botsite React PR1 #1305, CI/ledger/tool-pin hygiene #1308/#1317/#1320, dependency bumps + dashboard #1307/#1309/#1311/#1312/#1313/#1314/#1315); trimmed the live ledger to 20, moving #1208-band · #1226-band · #1211-band · #1210 · #1203-band · #1209-band · #1183-band to the archive.)* *(The twentieth Q-0107 pass — band-#1290, 2026-06-22 — added the band #1265–#1291 work as six grouped entries; trimmed the live ledger to 20, moving #1186 · #1156-band · #1147-band · #1143-band · #1162-band · #1149-band to the archive.)*

## Next candidates

- **Website two-site split — rollout + next steps:**
  [`operations/website-split-next-steps-2026-06-19.md`](operations/website-split-next-steps-2026-06-19.md)
  is the live handoff: the v1 build is **code-complete + reviewed** (#1109–#1119, hardened by #1122), and
  what remains is the owner-paced **rollout** (provision `botsite/` + the submissions DB, then domain
  cutover), the 3 review flags (moderation race · web-CI matrix · idea→subsystem mapping), and two
  security-review-gated slices (control-panel migration · live status aggregator).
- **Cross-area sequencing + the plan index now live in [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md)**
  (by area, with Now / Next / Later / Someday horizons + gates — where to find which plan
  for which part of the code). The picks below are the current top of that list.
- Server-management is **structurally complete** *(bullet corrected 2026-06-10 — it
  still queued PR14 long after the hub merged)*: **PR10 complete** (six slices,
  ADR-008), **PR11** (#570; governance section **deferred** — revisit only with a
  scope decision), **PR12** (2026-06-07), **PR13's deterministic slice** (2026-06-08,
  incl. the migration-059 staging fix), and **PR14 — the unified Server Management
  Hub — shipped 2026-06-08 via #584**. The only remainder is the **gated PR13 AI
  generation layer**. The `docs/planning/server-management-status-2026-06-05.md`
  tracker (re-badged `historical` 2026-06-13 — initiative complete) is the historical
  record; the gated PR13 AI tail lives in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) → Later. Don't duplicate it here.
- Health/diagnostics maintainer live-tests (production AI tool + grouped findings):
  see `docs/subsystems/health-diagnostics.md`.
- **Docs consolidation (Q-0010) — executed 2026-06-08.** Top-level `docs/` is now **16**
  (the 13 binding contracts + `current-state` + `roadmap` + `context-map-tooling`); plans /
  audits / inventories / historical snapshots moved into clustered subdirs behind their
  folios, and `_TOP_LEVEL_DOCS_BUDGET` lowered 41 → 16. Paired with the idea-backlog
  lifecycle + grooming secondary task (Q-0015, `docs/ideas/README.md`) and the binding-doc
  section-ownership convention (`docs/owner/ai-project-workflow.md` §9). The original handoff
  was [`planning/docs-restructure-brief-2026-06-08.md`](planning/docs-restructure-brief-2026-06-08.md).

## Gates / blocked work

- **Autonomous loop — see the canonical [Control-plane state table](operations/autonomous-routines.md)
  § "Control-plane state".** That table is the single source of truth for the loop's state (does it
  self-fire · `ROUTINE_PAT` · Railway env · dispatch-prompt version · model pins); **do not restate
  its verdict here.** This bullet is a pure pointer on purpose — a control-plane verdict copied into
  this file drifted from the canonical table twice (the band-#870 and band-#930 passes each had to
  re-sync it by hand), so the copy is deliberately gone (idea
  `control-plane-single-source-pointer-2026-06-15`). The live read no in-repo checker can see is the
  `reconcile` trigger-issue author (`menno420` = PAT set & loop self-fires; `github-actions[bot]` =
  PAT unset); `check_loop_health.py` (Q-0135) probes live GitHub for the same truth.
- **Open bugs (bug book):** **BUG-0009** (AI list-answer mislabeling — needs the AI orchestration §7
  deterministic list-builders, plan-level) and **BUG-0011** (Hermes gateway restart crash-loop — needs
  a clean VPS foreground repro) stay OPEN — [`health/bug-book.md`](health/bug-book.md).
- **Open decisions:** **Q-0096** remainder (Context7 adopted #737; **Postgres-MCP + `pyright-lsp`**
  undecided) · **Q-0120/Q-0121** (the workflow pass's proposals — candidate-rule promotion · Hermes
  bug-triage `gh issue create` write). *(**Q-0119 answered 2026-06-13** → governance role pointers
  get their own reserved-namespace `governance` schema home (option a); P0-3 family 3 is unblocked
  for a future arc PR — router §Q-0119 + the [convergence plan §5](planning/settings-pointer-lane-convergence-plan-2026-06-13.md).)*
- **AI / BTD6 feature expansion — re-postured 2026-06-09 (Q-0048):** AI tools that are
  **read-only AND deterministic** (no writes, no external calls, audience-tiered) carry a
  **standing lift** and may ship without a per-case ask. Anything that **writes, costs
  money, calls external services, or adds UI** still needs the per-exposure lift, and broad
  expansion stays gated on *all* of: bot-wide stability **+** provider/provenance checks
  **+** caching / source-health clarity **+** AI behavior/config correctness.
- **BTD6 data extraction** — ADR-006 provenance schema **now implemented**
  (`docs/btd6/btd6-provenance-schema.md`); extraction may resume against the ordered
  backlog in `docs/btd6/btd6-gamedata-decode-status.md`. The broader AI/BTD6
  feature-expansion gate (stability + provider/provenance + caching + AI config) still
  applies.
- `_derive_scope` → `PLATFORM_OWNER` (decision D1) — **RESOLVED** in #541; owner-only
  AI tools are now reachable.

## Known UX follow-ups (not stability bugs)

- Server-management member/role UX follow-ups: see
  `docs/subsystems/server-management.md`.
- Dense DiagnosticCog platform-subview pagination idea: see
  `docs/subsystems/health-diagnostics.md`.

## Near-term technical debt (decided, not yet implemented)

*(The Q-0025 `new_subsystem.py` scaffold that used to sit here is reconciled: built
and used to register Community Spotlight in **#626** (execution-plan Lane 1,
2026-06-09 — verify merged on live GitHub).)*

*(The Q-0026 `cog_name_to_subsystem` fix that used to sit here is reconciled: merged
in **#588**, listed under Recently shipped.)*

## Off-limits / do-not-propose

- No Redis / external state store (**ADR-001**).
- Game state is **not** restart-safe by design (**ADR-002**) — accepted, not a bug.
- Do not re-litigate the rejection ledger in
  `docs/planning/superbot-ideas-lab-2026-06-05.md` §6.
- Do not restate "bot fully tested & working" as *newly* verified without an actual
  boot + live walk — cite the #535 baseline instead.
- **No monetization that gates features** — no paywalls, premium/VIP feature tiers, freemium
  feature-gating, subscriptions, or pay-to-win (**Q-0190 North Star: free for everyone, forever**;
  generalizes Q-0039 no-P2W / no-billing). The *only* allowed money surface is a voluntary
  *zero-benefit* support/sponsor link to offset hosting + AI cost. Full statement:
  [`ideas/free-for-everyone-mission-2026-06-21.md`](ideas/free-for-everyone-mission-2026-06-21.md).

## Where to read next

The **canonical read path + "what lives where"** lives in
**`docs/AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`** ("Reading order by task" + the document-classification
lists). This file is *step 3* of that path: read it for **what is true right now**, then
follow the orientation route for your task. The read-path table is **not** duplicated
here — one canonical home (`AGENT_ORIENTATION.md`).

**One-fact-one-home rule:** if a fact belongs in one of those homes, **link** to it —
do not restate it here. Restatement across files is where drift breeds. In particular,
**don't summarize plans'/trackers' PR numbers or status here** — link to the folio or
tracker, which is authoritative for its own area.
