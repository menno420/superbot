"""Shared panel navigation helper — Phase 3.5.

Centralises the back-button + cross-panel transition logic that
previously lived inline in `help_cog._attach_back_to_help_button`,
`admin_cog.attach_back_to_admin_button`, `settings.subsystem_view.
attach_back_to_settings_button`, `games.hub.attach_back_to_games_button`,
and `LoggingRoutesView.btn_back`. Each of those re-implemented the
same three concerns:

1. The 25-component cap (Discord rejects views with >25 children).
2. A parent-builder call at click time — needed for governance-aware
   pagination, route-table refreshes, and resource re-resolution.
3. Defer → build → edit-in-place with consistent error handling so a
   parent-build failure surfaces as an ephemeral rather than a silent
   crash.

This module is intentionally small. It is **not** a UI framework — no
new view classes, no inheritance hierarchy, no decorator. Just two
functions and one type alias.

Phase 3.5 scope: ship the helper + migrate the safest call sites
(help cog's back injection + LoggingRoutesView back-to-logging).
Other duplicated factories (admin / settings / games) stay as-is
and migrate one PR at a time, on demand, when their owners are
already touched.

Cross-references — duplicated patterns in the codebase today:

* `disbot/cogs/help_cog.py:147-209` — back-to-help with governance
  re-resolve.
* `disbot/cogs/admin_cog.py:229-273` — back-to-admin (cog lookup +
  state mutation).
* `disbot/views/settings/subsystem_view.py:240-281` — back-to-settings
  with re-resolve.
* `disbot/views/games/hub.py:114-150` — back-to-games (no governance
  re-resolve; rebuilds from `SUBSYSTEMS`).
* `disbot/cogs/logging/routes_panel.py:btn_back` — back-to-logging.

class BackTarget:
    """A captured "what comes above me" for back-chain composition (AB2).

    Each opener in a Help → X → Y chain can stash a ``BackTarget`` on
    the child it opens (typically as ``child_view._back_target``). The
    child's own opener, when it builds back-to-Y, uses
    :func:`chain_back` to compose: pressing back rebuilds Y AND
    re-attaches the captured ``BackTarget`` on the rebuilt Y. This
    lets a deep navigation unwind all the way back to Help with each
    intermediate parent's back button still attached, without inventing
    a router or a stack.

    Persistent-view fail-safe: ``BackTarget`` MUST NOT be persisted
    across bot restarts (the ``builder`` closure cannot be
    serialized). Persistent-view re-registration must construct views
    without a ``_back_target``; in that case the panel still works
    as the top-of-stack and click-time governance recheck (PR D) is
    the correctness safety net.

    ephemeral fallback. The original message is NOT edited (preserving
    whatever the user was looking at).
